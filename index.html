<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Approximation Algorithms</h2><p>Covering the basic techniques used in the latest research work, the author consolidates progress made so far, including some very recent and promising results, and conveys the beauty and excitement of work in the field. He gives clear, lucid explanations of key results and ideas, with intuitive proofs, and provides critical examples and numerous illustrations to help elucidate the algorithms. Many of the results presented have been simplified and new insights provided. Of interest to theoretical computer scientists, operations researchers, and discrete mathematicians.</p><p><p>&nbsp;This book covers the dominant theoretical approaches to the approximate solution of hard combinatorial optimization and enumeration problems. It contains elegant combinatorial theory, useful and interesting algorithms, and deep results about the intrinsic complexity of combinatorial problems. Its clarity of exposition and excellent selection of exercises will make it accessible and appealing to all those with a taste for mathematics and algorithms.</p> <p>Richard Karp,University Professor, University of California at Berkeley</p> <p>Following the development of basic combinatorial optimization techniques in the 1960s and 1970s, a main open question was to develop a theory of approximation algorithms. In the 1990s, parallel developments in techniques for designing approximation algorithms as well as methods for proving hardness of approximation results have led to a beautiful theory. The need to solve truly large instances of computationally hard problems, such as those arising from the Internet or the human genome project, has also increased interest in this theory. The field is currently very active, with the toolbox of approximation algorithm design techniques getting always richer.</p> <p>It is a pleasure to recommend Vijay Vazirani's well-written and comprehensive book on this important and timely topic. I am sure the reader will find it most useful both as an introduction to approximability as well as a reference to the many aspects of approximation algorithms.</p> <p>L�szl� Lov�sz, Senior Researcher, Microsoft Research</p><p>From the reviews:</p> <p></p> <p>"Approximation algorithms is an area where much progress has been made in the last 10 years. The book under review is a very good help for understanding these results. In each of the 27 chapters an important combinatorial optimization problem is presented and one or more approximation algorithms for it are clearly and concisely described and analyzed. In this way most of the most important results from the approximation algorithm literature are covered, often more easily comprehensible than the original articles." (Viggo Kann, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1005, 2003)</p> <p>"The book under review concentrates on the ... design and analysis of efficient approximation algorithms with good performance guarantees. It is possibly the first textbook to provide an extensive and systematic coverage of this topic. ... The book starts briskly, using simple examples to illustrate some of the key concepts and draw the reader rapidly in. ... Copious exercises are included to test and deepen the reader&#x2019;s understanding. ... It deserves a place in every computer science and mathematical library." (Mark R. Jerrum, Mathematical Reviews, 2002 h)</p> <p>"The book of Vijay Vazirani is not the first one dedicated to approximation algorithms ... . However it is, I believe, among the very best from a didactical point of view: this is the text I would chose, would I have to give a course on approximation algorithms ... . I suspect that for many researchers it would be the first one to consult ... . It is a must acquisition for libraries of computer science/engineering departments ... ." (Francesco Maffioli, Mathematical Methods of Operations Research, Vol. 56 (2), 2002)</p> <p>"The book gives an overview on the theory of approximation algorithms. It presents the most important problems, the basic methods and ideas which are used in this area. ... The book can be used for a graduate course on approximation algorithms. ... The chapters also contain a section of exercises, which can help the students to understand the material in a deeper way. ... On the other hand the book can be used by the researchers of the field ... ."

Now, not only does it reflect the most recent changes in technology, but it also incorporates material from Application Concepts of Process Control, Murrill's much-praised book on putting theory into practice. </p><p>Here are classic principles that govern process control, particularly feedback control, as well as recent technologies such as statistical process control and expert systems. New chapters focus on the conceptual framework for an application, offering a practical understanding of the theory, along with specific illustrations on how concepts are implemented.</p></p><p>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION <p>Fundamentals of Process Control Theory was written in 1981 as a prototype for ISA's Independent Learning Module publication series, and it rapidly became the best-selling book ever published by ISA. With the publication of the second edition in 1991, the strong popular acceptance continued and the book has approached "classic" status. This is especially satisfying for an author. </p><p>This textbook is designed for independent self-study. It is for the practicing engineer, first-line supervisor, or senior technician. College, university, and technical school students will also find the material appropriate. Fundamentals of Process Control Theory is designed to teach the basic principles or process automation and demonstrate how these principles are applied in modern industrial practice. Some knowledge of mathematics is necessary, of course, but I have made efforts to prevent the mathematics from being a barrier to study by those without strong math skills. The material is designed as an introductory or first-level course. A quick review into the specific topics covered. </p><p>This book is intended to be both theoretical and practical--that is, to show the basic concepts of process control theory and how these concepts are used in daily practice. This is a book about fundamentals, concepts, ideas, principles, theory, and behavior. It is not about hardware and software. To some extent, however, we all know that hardware and software will dictate what "theory" can be used and useful. Thus, the actual implementation of process control theory changes as hardware and software change, and this march of progress has made a third edition necessary. I hope this new edition proves useful to you, the student. </p><p>An effort has been made to make this presentation consistent with the various standards and practices used throughout the various worlds of process control and instrumentation. I have attempted to ensure that no significant inconsistency exists with the standards relating to terminology, especially Process Instrumentation Terminology, ANSI/ISA-S51.1-1979 (R 1993), and that is reflected in both the text and the Glossary given in Appendix B. Some minor inconsistencies may be noted wiht ANSI/ISA-S5.1-1984 (Reaffirmed 1992) Instrumentation Symbols and Identification (referenced and excerpted in Appendix A), in some of the figures of the presentation, but in no case have I found this to lead to confusion for students. </p><p>My special thanks goes to all who made the first and second editions of this book so successful. It is my hope that the revisions for the third edition, many of which were suggested by you, will make it even better. </p><p>Paul W. Murrill, July 1999</p></p><h2>The Slave&#39;s Cause: A History of Abolition</h2><p><b>Winner of the 2017 Frederick Douglass Prize<br><br> A groundbreaking history of abolition that recovers the largely forgotten role of African Americans in the long march toward emancipation from the American Revolution through the Civil War</b><br><br> Received historical wisdom casts abolitionists as bourgeois, mostly white reformers burdened by racial paternalism and economic conservatism. Manisha Sinha overturns this image, broadening her scope beyond the antebellum period usually associated with abolitionism and recasting it as a radical social movement in which men and women, black and white, free and enslaved found common ground in causes ranging from feminism and utopian socialism to anti-imperialism and efforts to defend the rights of labor. Drawing on extensive archival research, including newly discovered letters and pamphlets, Sinha documents the influence of the Haitian Revolution and the centrality of slave resistance in shaping the ideology and tactics of abolition. This book is a comprehensive new history of the abolition movement in a transnational context. It illustrates how the abolitionist vision ultimately linked the slave&#x2019;s cause to the struggle to redefine American democracy and human rights across the globe.<br><br> Honors include:<ul><li>Longlist title for the 2016 National Book Awards Nonfiction category</li><li>Winner of the 2017 Best Book Prize by the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic</li><li>Winner of the 2016 Avery O.

John M. Charap&#x2019;s classroom-tested introduction to the mathematical foundations of the topic presents the material in an approachable manner.</p><p>Charap begins with a historical overview of electrodynamics and a discussion of the preliminary mathematics one needs in order to grasp the advanced and abstract concepts underlying the theory. He walks the reader through Maxwell&#x2019;s four equations, explaining how they were developed and demonstrating how they are applied. From there, Charap moves through the other components of electrodynamics, such as Lorentz transformations, tensors, and charged particle behavior. At each point, he carefully works through the mathematics, applies the concepts to simple physical systems, and provides historical context that makes clear the connections among the theories and the mathematicians responsible for developing them. A concluding chapter reviews the history of electrodynamics and points the way for independent testing of the theory.</p><p>Thorough, evenly paced, and intuitive, this friendly introduction to high-level covariant electrodynamics is a handy and helpful addition to any physicist&#x2019;s toolkit.</p></p><p><p><b>John M.

It describes major developments in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease in the twentieth century, explains how the Mayo Clinic evolved from a family practice in Minnesota into one of the world's leading medical centers, and reveals how the invention of new technologies and procedures promoted specialization among physicians and surgeons. <br><br><em>Caring for the Heart</em> is written for general readers as well as health care professionals, historians, and policy analysts. Unlike traditional institutional or disease-focused histories, this book places individuals and events in national and international contexts that emphasize the interplay of medical, scientific, technological, social, political, and economic forces that have resulted in contemporary heart care. Patient stories and media perspectives are included throughout to help general readers understand the medical and technological developments that are described. <br><br>The book is a synthetic study, but it is written so that readers may pick and choose the chapters of most interest to them. Another feature of the book is that readers may follow the stories without looking at the notes. Those who are interested in delving deeper into the main topics will find a wealth of carefully chosen references that offer greater detail and additional perspectives. The descriptions and interpretations that fill the book benefit from the fact that the author has been a practicing cardiologist and medical historian for almost four decades. <br>This is mainly a twentieth-century story, but it begins earlier--before there were physicians who were identified as cardiologists and at a time when medical specialization was just emerging in America. The final chapter, which addresses present-day concerns about health care costs, counterbalances earlier ones that might be read as celebrations of new technologies.<br></p><p><br><strong>W.

This volume is unique as its focus is on the emergence and development of an institution whose goal is to do the very best that cardiology offers, and to apply this knowledge to patient care. Reading through the chapters, one becomes quickly aware that the Mayo Clinic has successfully implemented a partnership between the management of the institution, the clinical and scientific faculty, and the patients-including both their physical and emotional care and well-being. The best illustration of this is shown by the development of open-heart surgery beginning in the 1950s. The story of this advance of cardiology at the Mayo Clinic is unique and fascinating, but so is what it has done to extend or improve the lives of thousands of patients.

Anthologies of Native American orators typically focus on the rhetoric of western speakers but overlook the contributions of Eastern speakers. The roles women played, both as speakers themselves and as creators of the speeches delivered by the men, are also commonly overlooked. Finally, most anthologies mine only English-language sources, ignoring the fraught records of the earliest Spanish conquistadors and French adventurers. This study fills all these gaps and also challenges the conventional assumption that Native thought had little or no impact on liberal perspectives and critiques of Europe. Essays are arranged so that the speeches progress chronologically to reveal the evolving assessments and responses to the European presence in North America, from the mid-sixteenth century to the twentieth century.</p><p></p><p>Providing a discussion of the history, culture, and oratory of eastern Native Americans, this work will appeal to scholars of Native American history and of communications and rhetoric.

This book explores how and why this is the case. Sensationalized cases often drive criminal justice policies that can sometimes be impulsively enacted and misguided. While there is a chapter that examines the insanity defense and competency, the primary focus of the book is on the bulk of cases that clog the criminal justice system with persons with mental illnesses (pwmi). Criminal justice practitioners are often ill-equipped for dealing with pwmi in crises, and this may even result in the emergence of mental disabilities for criminal justice professionals. However, via application of therapeutic jurisprudence principles some agencies are better preparing their employees for such encounters and attempting to stop the inhumane and costly recycling of pwmi through the criminal justice system. Coverage runs the gamut from specialized law enforcement responses, to mental health courts, to jails and prisons, to discharge planning, diversion, re-entry, and outpatient commitment. Also, criminal justice practitioners in their own words provide insight into and examples of the interface between the mental health and criminal justice systems. Throughout the book the balance between maintaining public safety and preserving civil liberties is considered as the state&#39;s police power and parens patriae roles are examined. Lastly, collaborative approaches for influencing and informing policies that are often driven by crises are discussed.</p><p>Risdon N.

With its purloined jewels, its conniving, resilient, mercenary heroine, and its partiality for the human spectacle in all its complexity, The Eustace Diamonds is a splendid example of Trollope&#39;s art at its most assured.<p><strong>Anthony Trollope </strong>(1815-1882) grew up in London.

He wrote series of books set in the English countryside as well as those set in the political life, works that show great psychological penetration.

Regan's new translation of texts from Thomas Aquinas' <i>Summa Theologica</i> II&#x2013;II--on the virtues prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance--combines accuracy with an accessibility unmatched by previous presentations of these texts. While remaining true to Aquinas' Latin and preserving a question-and-answer format, the translation judiciously omits references and citations unessential to the primary argument. It thereby clears a path through the original especially suitable for beginning students of Aquinas. Regan's Introduction carefully situates Aquinas' analysis of these virtues within the greater ethical system of the <i>Summa Theologica</i>, and each selection is introduced by a thoughtful headnote. A glossary of key terms and a select bibliography are also included.</p></p><p><p>Richard J. Regan is a Research Professor of Political Science, Fordham University.</p><p>Thomas Aquinas is still known in ethics primarily as the quintessential theorist of natural law&#x2015;this despite the fact that his writings on that subject are quite meager in comparison to his exhaustive and masterly treatments of the virtues. The result of Richard Regan's labors is an introduction to Thomas' moral philosophy that is much more indicative of Thomas' rich reflections on the moral life than is available from the study of his natural law writings alone, making accessible Thomas' insights into the cardinal virtues of justice, prudence, courage, and temperance. --Douglas Kries, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Gonzaga University</p><br><br><p>There are perils here for a clumsy editor. Some of the material inviting excision is comparatively ephemeral but some is so integral to the work that its exclusion would leave us with a seriously distorted patchwork with few clues as to the overall world-view of the author. There is also a good deal of material that is contrary to contemporary culture and which timidity would suggest be excised. But Regan's editorial hand is deft. If mortal and venial sin, salvation, the value of consecrated virginity, the immorality of taking interest on a loan are unpalatable to the modern reader, he does not see that as any reason for excluding them. We find startling the prohibition of lying to the enemy in time of war, and the observation that it is permissible to resist an unjust death sentence 'except perhaps, in order to avoid scandal, when resistance might risk a serious public disturbance' (86). This is just one example of the profoundly counter-cultural weighting of the community over the individual in the Natural Law tradition (This is very briefly but effectively flagged by Regan in his Introduction). The extent of the condensation [in Regan's edition] is considerable. . . . Surely he must have left out something of value? I searched for unfortunate omissions. Did he include the distinction between virtue and skill (in terms of intentional failure)? Yes. Does the thesis of the unity of the virtues survive? Yes again. Is the possibility of prudence in sinners included? Yes it is, and the search for omissions begins to seem a waste of time. . . . I would judge the translation to be a fine effort. --Brian Scarlett, <i>The Medieval Review</i></p><br><br><p>Richard J. Regan's translation and introductory explanations are highly readable and very accessible to the average student. There is a wealth of material contained in this small volume. It could serve not only as a useful text in an ethics course, but also as a convenient initiation to Aquinas' thought and method. --Rev. Gerald E. Twaddell, Department of Philosophy, Thomas More College</p></p><h2>An Incomplete Dictionary of Show Birds</h2><p>&#34;It all started very innocently I suppose, but then it gradually turned into an obsession ....&#34; The first inkling of this obsession came when British photographer Luke Stephenson (born 1983) met an artist who photographed pigeons--side on, against a blank background. Impressed by the simplicity of these images, Stephenson began to photograph birds. His first subjects belonged to the treasurer of the UK Budgie Society, who deemed his portraits &#34;crap&#34; because he had omitted the legs and tails. He subsequently developed an eye for the nuances of bird photography, and, making a specialty of photographing show birds of all kinds, developed the body of work gathered in this volume. While Stephenson&#39;s photographs depict these birds with apparent neutrality (against a variety of colored backgrounds), Michael Smith observes in his foreword to this volume that &#34;they live in an overlap between the natural and manmade worlds, and say as much about the culture that created them as they do about nature.&#34;</p><p>80 Pages with 60 Colour Plates of budgies English and Latin names for all birds.

Janis Lull&#39;s introduction to this new edition, which is based on the First Folio, emphasises the play&#39;s tragic themes--individual identity, determinism and choice--and stresses the importance of women&#39;s roles. A thorough performance history of stage and film versions shows how the text has been cut, rewritten and re-shaped by directors and actors to enhance the role of Richard at the expense of other parts, especially those of the women.The Shakespearean Originals Series takes as its point of departure the question: &#34;What is it that we read Shakespeare?&#34; The answer may seem self-evident: we read the words that Shakespeare wrote. But do we? In the case of all the major editions of Shakespeare available in the market, the fact of the matter is that many of the words that we read in an edition of, say, Hamlet, never appeared in the text as it was printed during or shortly after Shakespeare&#39;s own lifetime. They are th e interpetations and interpolations of a series of editors who have been systematically changign Shakespeare&#39;s text from the eighteenth century onwards.

Instead of the focussed computer programs in BASIC, the authors provide 10 interactive JAVA-applets for this second edition.</p><p>Fascinating and authoritative, <i>Chaos and Fractals: New Frontiers of Science</i> is a truly remarkable book that documents recent discoveries in chaos theory with plenty of mathematical detail, but without alienating the general reader. In all, this text offers an extremely rich and engaging tour of this quite revolutionary branch of mathematical research.<p> The most appealing aspect about <i>Chaos and Fractals</i> has to be its hundreds of images and graphics (with dozens in full-color) used to illustrate key concepts. Even the math-averse reader should be able to follow the basic presentation of chaos and fractals here. Since fractals often mimic natural shapes such as mountains, plants, and other biological forms, they lend themselves especially well to visual representation.</p><p> Early chapters here document the mathematical oddities (or "monsters") such as the Sierpinski Gasket and the Koch Curve, which laid the groundwork for later discoveries in fractals. The book does a fine job of placing recent discoveries about chaos into a tradition of earlier mathematical research. Its description of the work of mathematicians like Pascal, Kepler, Poincar�, Sierpinski, Koch, and Mandelbrot makes for a fine read, a detective story that ends with the discovery of <i>order</i> in chaos. (For programmers, the authors provide short algorithms and BASIC code, which lets you try out plotting various fractals on your own.) </p><p> This is not, however, only a book of pretty pictures. For the reader who needs the mathematics behind chaos theory, the authors in no way dumb down the details. (But because the richer mathematical material is set off from the main text, the general reader can still make headway without getting lost.)</p><p> There have been advances in the field since this book's publication in 1992, but <i>Chaos and Fractals</i> remains an authoritative general reference on chaos theory and fractals. A must for math students (and math enthusiasts), <i>Chaos and Fractals</i> also deserves a place on the bookshelf of any general reader or programmer who wants to understand how today's mathematicians and scientists make sense of our world using chaos theory. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: Overview of fractals and chaos theory, feedback and multiple reduction copy machines (MRCMs), the Cantor Set, the Sierpinski Gasket and Carpet, the Pascal Triangle, the Koch Curve, Julia Sets, similarity, measuring fractal curves, fractal dimensions, transformations and contraction mapping, image compression, chaos games, fractals and nature, L-systems, cellular automata basics, attractors and strange attractors, Henon's Attractor, R�ssler and Lorenz Attractors, randomness in fractals, the Brownian motion, fractal landscapes, sensitivity and periodic points, complex arithmetic basics, the Mandelbrot Set, and multifractal measures.</p><p>&#x201c;It is relatively discursive and easy to read, with each chapter telling a coherent story, and it highlights the key concepts and ideas, examining a few models in detail and using worked numerical examples as well as visualisations and illustrations ... . makes an excellent entry to the broader mathematics of fractals and chaos, especially for students who are curious about the details as well as the core concepts but don&#x2019;t want to get bogged down in formal mathematics.&#x201d; (Danny Yee, Danny Yee&#x2019;s Book reviews, February, 2016)</p> <p>"It is one of the best introductions to chaos and fractals around. ... Unlike some other books on fractals, it can be read by non-specialists ... . The book is beautifully produced and well illustrated so it is a pleasure to read." (Hugh Williams, The Mathematical Gazette, Vol. 90 (5l9), 2006)</p><p>"The first edition of this vast introduction to chaos and fractals appeared in 1992. This new edition is virtually identical to the original except for some material ... . the book is ... a wonderful tour of a fascinating area of mathematics, and now the reader can take this tour while carrying around a slimmer (but still hefty) volume. ... The authors have a friendly conversational style ... . This is a great book ... ." (Raymond N. Greenwell, MathDL, May, 2005)</p><p>"Chaos and Fractals: New Frontiers of Science is an amazing introduction to the ideas of fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics ... . The authors have done a tremendous job in explaining quite difficult concepts in an elegant and simple way ... . I enjoyed this book tremendously &#x2013; the authors have put in a tremendous amount of work in making a vast and interesting subject accessible ... . I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone with even a passing interest in the subject matter." (Dr. S. Virmani, Contemporary Physics, Vol. 46 (6), 2005)</p><p>"There appeared many books in the 1980&#x2019;s and early 1990&#x2019;s that ... required only a limited mathematical background to understand. They made the fractals, chaos and the Mandelbrot and Julia sets quite popular ... . The ... book that is under review here is one of these popular books. ... The book will remain what it has been so far: an outstanding book that contains all you ever wanted to know about fractals and chaos accessible to all levels of mathematically skilled." (Bulletin of the Belgian Mathematical Society, Vol. 12 (3), 2005)</p><p>"The book is written for everyone who wants to learn details of chaos theory and fractal geometry, also for readers who have not much knowledge of technical mathematics. In the fourteen chapters the central ideas and concepts of chaos and fractals are developed ... ." (F. Haslinger, Monatshefte f�r Mathematik, Vol. 144 (4), 2005)</p><p>"This is the second ... edition of what has been a bestseller since its first publication in 1992. ... All the laudatory comments heard twelve years ago about this fascinating book remain entirely valid. No one has succeeded in better presenting ... . the presentation has not aged at all &#x2013; the comprehensiveness of the underlying mathematics and the illustrative power of the figures has never been surpassed. Twelve years after its first edition this book remains a must buy." (Andr� Hautot, Physicalia, Vol. 57 (3), 2005)</p><p>"Numerous books have appeared in recent years that either explore the beauty of fractal art, describe techniques for its creation, or investigate some aspect of the related field of chaotic behavior. The present work attempts to accomplish all three goals in one huge volume...the authors should be applauded for their ambitions undertaking."<i>&nbsp;Mathematical Reviews</i></p><p> </p><p>"This book ... contains all one ever wanted to know about fractals, and more. Written by&#x2013;next to Mandelbrot&#x2013;the greatest popularizer of the concept of fractal geometry ... It contains a wealth of information on nearly every angle of the topic...

In so doing he describes a significant intellectual and spiritual movement and provides new and controversial insights into Dickens' fiction.</p><p> The mesmeric movement in England, particularly its controversial activities during the late 1830s and the 1840s, intensified Dickens' concern with the ways in which people discover and exert their energies and will to control each other. Dickens' own activities as a mesmerist provide the biographical touchstone for his image of himself as a doctor of the mind. Fred Kaplan examines the author's entire oeuvre in a synoptic, thematic fashion, exploring the attitudes shaped by the mesmerists that are reflected in the novels' psychological tensions. The final chapter provides an overview of the Romantic, Victorian, and Modern currents that may be found in Dickens' fascination with mesmeric power.</p><p>Originally published in 1975.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Anything that can be distributed will be distributed: workforces, organizations, supply webs, and more. The tired practices of centralized organizations will become brittle in a future where authority is radically decentralized. Rigid hierarchies will give way to liquid structures. Most leaders&#x2014;and most organizations&#x2014;aren&#x2019;t ready for this future. Are you?<br><br> It&#x2019;s too late to catch up, but it&#x2019;s a great time to leapfrog. Noted futurist Bob Johansen goes beyond skills and competencies to propose five new leadership literacies&#x2014;combinations of disciplines, practices, and worldviews&#x2014;that will be needed to thrive in a VUCA world of increasing volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. This book shows how to (1) forecast likely futures so you can &#x201c;look back&#x201d; and make sure you&#x2019;re prepared now for the changes to come, (2) use low-risk gaming spaces to work through your concerns about the future and hone your leadership skills, (3) lead shape-shifting organizations where you can&#x2019;t just tell people what to do, (4) be a dynamic presence even when you&#x2019;re not there in person, and (5) keep your personal energy high and transmit that energy throughout your organization. <br><br> This visionary book provides a vivid description of the ideal talent profile for future leaders. It is written for current, rising star, and aspiring leaders; talent scouts searching for leaders; and executive coaches seeking a fresh view of how leaders will need to prepare. To get ready for this future, we will all need new leadership literacies.</p><p>Our future will be radically decentralized, digitized, and disrupted.

Yet it can be a challenging work to teach--Vergil is a complex, subtle poet; his culture and time are removed from us; and Latin is less studied in college than it was a generation ago.</p> <p>Part 1 of this volume, "Materials," critiques the main English translations, lists reference works and resources (including those on the Internet), and gives an overview of criticism. Part 2, "Approaches," strikes a balance between traditional and new approaches to the text. Among the subjects of these essays are Augustan politics, Homeric parallels, key terms (<em>pietas</em>, <em>furor</em>), narrative techniques, uses of simile, images of women, the treatment of warfare, and comparisons of the Aeneid with such works as Dante's <em>Divine Comedy</em> and Milton's <em>Paradise Lost</em>.</p></p><p>William S.

And in the decade before the outbreak of the American Revolution, thousands of his fellow colonists flocked to the Georgian city in its first big wave of American visitors. At the very point of political rupture, mother country and colonies were socially and culturally closer than ever before. In this first-ever portrait of eighteenth-century London as the capital of America, Julie M. Flavell re-creates the famous city&#x2019;s heyday as the center of an empire that encompassed North America and the West Indies. The momentous years before independence saw more colonial Americans than ever in London&#x2019;s streets: wealthy Southern plantation owners in quest of culture, slaves hoping for a chance of freedom, Yankee businessmen looking for opportunities in the city, even Ben Franklin seeking a second, more distinguished career. The stories of the colonials, no innocents abroad, vividly re-create a time when Americans saw London as their own and remind us of the complex, multiracial&#x2014;at times even decadent&#x2014;nature of America&#x2019;s colonial British heritage.</p></p><p><b>Julie Flavell</b>, the author and editor of many scholarly and popular publications on the relationship between colonial America and Britain, including <i>Britain and America Go to War,</i> is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and an independent scholar.

He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367&#x2013;47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias&#x2019;s relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343&#x2013;2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip&#x2019;s death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of &#x201c;Peripatetics&#x201d;), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander&#x2019;s death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows: I. Practical: <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>; <i>Great Ethics</i> (<i>Magna Moralia</i>); <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>; <i>Politics</i>; <i>Oeconomica</i> (on the good of the family); <i>Virtues and Vices</i>.</p><p> II. Logical: <i>Categories</i>; <i>On Interpretation</i>; <i>Analytics</i> (<i>Prior</i> and <i>Posterior</i>); <i>On Sophistical Refutations</i>; <i>Topica</i>.</p><p> III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc.</p><p> IV. <i>Metaphysics</i>: on being as being.</p><p> V. On Art: <i>Art of Rhetoric</i> and <i>Poetics</i>.</p><p> VI. Other works including the <i>Athenian Constitution</i>; more works also of doubtful authorship.</p><p> VII. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics.

Despite the fact that it's often a hard sell at first (what teenager wouldn't cringe at the thought of 400-plus pages of talking rabbits?), Richard Adams's bunny-centric epic rarely fails to win the love and respect of anyone who reads it, regardless of age. Like most great novels, <i>Watership Down</i> is a rich story that can be read (and reread) on many different levels. The book is often praised as an allegory, with its analogs between human and rabbit culture (a fact sometimes used to goad skeptical teens, who resent the challenge that they won't "get" it, into reading it), but it's equally praiseworthy as just a corking good adventure.<p> The story follows a warren of Berkshire rabbits fleeing the destruction of their home by a land developer. As they search for a safe haven, skirting danger at every turn, we become acquainted with the band and its compelling culture and mythos. Adams has crafted a touching, involving world in the dirt and scrub of the English countryside, complete with its own folk history and language (the book comes with a "lapine" glossary, a guide to rabbitese). As much about freedom, ethics, and human nature as it is about a bunch of bunnies looking for a warm hidey-hole and some mates, <i>Watership Down</i> will continue to make the transition from classroom desk to bedside table for many generations to come. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Cambridge Companion to Karl Rahner (Cambridge Companions to Religion)</h2><p>Karl Rahner (1904-1984) was one of the most significant theological voices of the twentieth century.

The H�tel de Beauharnais, constructed in 1713, gained renown during the Consulate period. In 1803, Josephine Bonaparte acquired the property for her son, Eug�ne de Beauharnais, and had the building renovated and decorated at great expense. At the fall of the Napoleonic Empire, it was sold to the King of Prussia and became an embassy during the nineteenth century.

"Meaning is being," Dossey ( Beyond Illness ) states in his introduction, arguing that the significance we give to events in our lives and to our existence itself affects our body's health. Pointing out that more heart attacks happen on Mondays at 9 a.m. than any other time of the week, he also supports his thesis with numerous case histories. Decrying the "man as machine" approach often promulgated in medical school, Dossey urges doctors and patients alike to recognize the spiritual component of healing, while pressing for such practical reforms as making hospital environments more pleasant. His study will prove valuable for professional and lay readers alike. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Dossey, an internist and noted author/lecturer on holistic medicine ( Space, Time and Medicine , LJ 5/15/82), writes that illness has meaning in itself and needs to be approached through understanding, not just intervention. Even the contemporary mind-body notion is outdated, he suggests, asserting that "mind" and consciousness exist beyond the bounds of the brain. Chronicling numerous incidents where beliefs, hopes, and miraculous events have brought about unexpected recoveries as well as inexplicable sickness and even death, Dossey sees medicine moving toward a less mechanical and more spiritual, psychic, or shamanic perspective on illness and its significance. His book is recommended for large public libraries and subject collections.<br><i>- Judith Eannarino, Washington, D.C.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Russia&#39;s Foreign Policy: Change and Continuity in National Identity</h2><p>Now fully updated and revised, this clear and comprehensive text explores contemporary Soviet/Russian international relations, comparing foreign policy formation under Gorbachev, Yeltsin, Medvedev, and Putin. Challenging conventional views of Moscow&#x2019;s foreign policy, Andrei Tsygankov shows that definitions of national interest depend on visions of national identity and are rooted both in history and domestic politics. Yet the author also highlights the role of the external environment in affecting the balance of power among competing domestic groups. <br><br>Drawing on both Russian and Western sources, Tsygankov traces how Moscow&#x2019;s policies have shifted under different leaders&#x2019; visions of Russia&#x2019;s national interests. He gives an overview of the ideas and pressures that motivated Russian foreign policy in six different periods: the Gorbachev era of the late 1980s, the liberal &#x201c;Westernizers&#x201d; era under Kozyrev in the early 1990s, the relatively hardline statist policy under Primakov, the more pragmatic course of limited cooperation under Putin and then Medvedev, and the assertive policy Putin has implemented since his return to power. Evaluating the successes and failures of Russian foreign policies, Tsygankov explains its many turns as Russia&#x2019;s identity and interaction with the West have evolved. The book concludes with reflections on the emergence of the post-Western world and the challenges it presents to Russia&#x2019;s enduring quest for great power status along with its desire for a special relationship with Western nations. <br></p><p>Andrei P.

Ferber&#39;s novels generally featured strong female protagonists, although she fleshed out multiple characters in each book. She usually highlighted at least one strong secondary character who faced discrimination ethnically or for other reasons; through this technique, Ferber demonstrated her belief that people are people and that the not-so-pretty persons have the best character. Due to her imagination in scene, characterization and plot, several theatrical and film productions have been made based on her works, including Show Boat, Giant, Saratoga Trunk, Cimarron (which won an Oscar) and the 1960 remake. Two of these works - Show Boat and Saratoga Trunk - were developed into musicals. When composer Jerome Kern proposed turning the very serious Show Boat into a musical, Ferber was shocked, thinking it would be transformed into a typical light entertainment of the 1920s, and it was not until Kern explained that he and Oscar Hammerstein II wanted to create a different type of musical that Ferber granted him the rights. Saratoga (musical) was written at a much later date, after serious plots had become acceptable in stage musicals. In 1925, she won the Pulitzer Prize for her book So Big, which was made into a silent film starring Colleen Moore that same year. An early talkie movie remake followed, in 1932, starring Barbara Stanwyck and George Brent, with Bette Davis in a supporting role. It was the only movie Stanwyck and Davis ever appeared in together, and Stanwyck played Davis&#39; mother-in-law, although only a year older in real life, which allegedly displeased her, as did the attitude of the hoydenish Davis. A 1953 remake of So Big starred Jane Wyman in the Stanwyck role, and is the version most often seen today.&#34;As in all Miss Ferber&#39;s work there is a certain fine, human quality in these stories which makes a swift and irresistible appeal.&#34; -- New York Times</p><h2>The Philosophy of Death</h2><p>The Philosophy of Death is a discussion of the basic philosophical issues concerning death, and a critical introduction to the relevant contemporary philosophical literature. Luper begins by addressing questions about those who die: What is it to be alive? What does it mean for you and me to exist? Under what conditions do we persist over time, and when do we perish? Next, he considers several questions concerning death, including: What does dying consist in; in particular, how does it differ from ageing? Must death be permanent? By what signs may it be identified? Is death bad for the one who dies? If so why? Finally he discusses whether, and why, killing is morally objectionable, and suggests that it is often permissible; in particular, (assisted) suicide, euthanasia and abortion may all be morally permissible. His book is a lively and engaging philosophical treatment of a perennially fascinating and relevant subject.</p><p>The Philosophy of Death is a lively and engaging discussion of the basic philosophical issues concerning death, and a critical introduction to the relevant contemporary philosophical literature.

In <em>Laws of Form</em> we have a mathematical formalism based on one symbol and an approach to the question how the world would appear if a distinction could be drawn. <em>Laws of Form</em> does not answer the question how, given nothing as a beginning, a distinction can, indeed must, inevitably take place.

He is Builder, Fireman, Protector, and Scout, overcoming waves and conquering monsters. Enter Marianne and doll, Mother and Baby, eager to redefine Eli as a good father and homesteader. Their separate visions intertwine in a search for a common ground on which howling wolves and butterfly sisters can learn to understand and need one another.</p><p>What can the richly imagined, impressively adaptable fantasy world of these children tell us about childhood, development, education, and even life itself? For fifty years, teacher and writer Vivian Gussin Paley has been exploring the imagery, language, and lore of young children, asking the questions they ask of themselves.</p><p>In The Boy on the Beach she continues to do so, going deeper into the mystery of play as she follows Eli and Marianne through the kindergarten year, finding more answers and more questions. How does their teacher, Mrs. Olson, manage to honor and utilize the genius of play to create an all-inclusive community in which boys and girls like each other and listen to each other&#x2019;s stories? Why is Paley&#x2019;s fellow teacher Yu-ching in Taiwan certain that her children pretend to be kittens in order to become necessary to the group? And why do teachers in London see their childrens&#x2019; role-playing as the natural end to loneliness in the school community?</p><p>Rich with the words of children and teachers themselves, The Boy on the Beach is vintage Paley, a wise and provocative appreciation of the importance of play and enduring curiosity about the nature of childhood and the imagination.</p></p><p><p><b>Vivian Gussin Paley</b> worked for nearly forty years as a preschool and kindergarten teacher and is the author of thirteen books about young children, including, most recently, <i>A Child&#x2019;s Work: The Importance of Fantasy Play. </i></p>Looking deeply into the "why" and "how come" of children at play, author and long-time preschool/kindergarten teacher Paley (A Child's Work) presents a series of contemplative conversations (with the reader, fellow educators and herself) that use her work with spontaneous and guided theatrical play to demonstrate the value of narrative to education, intellectual development, and mental well-being. While searching for deeper meaning in the business of child's play, Paley has developed a process for theatrically staging students' own stories, and "finding the metaphor in the moment" in order to guide play toward satisfying closure; chronicling her classroom visits to share her process with other educators, her methods prove highly illustrative. Paley explains how people-and not just children-play in order to find characters who represent them, place emotional events in recognizable context, demonstrate their own usefulness, and create common memories for later discussion. Paley also cites interesting literary references throughout, and includes illuminating correspondence between educators. Parents and teachers alike will gain insight from Paley's contemplative, creative approach to play. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Kantorwicz&#39;s The King&#39;s Two Bodies: A Study in Medieval Political Theology (The Macat Library)</h2><p><p>Few historians trace grand themes across many centuries and places, but Ernst Kantorowicz's great work on the symbolic powers of kingship is a fine example of what can happen when they do. <em>The King's Two Bodies</em> is at once a superb example of the critical thinking skill of evaluation &#x2013; assessing huge quantities of evidence, both written and visual, and drawing sound comparative conclusions from it &#x2013; and of creative thinking; the work connects art history, literature, legal records and historical documents together in innovative and revealing ways across more than 800 years of history. Kantorowicz's key conclusions (that history is at root about ideas, that these ideas power institutions, and that both are commonly expressed and understood through symbols) have had a profound impact on several different disciplines, and even underpin many works of popular fiction &#x2013; not least The DaVinci Code. And they were all made possible by fresh evaluation of evidence that other historians had ignored, or could not see the significance of.</p></p><p><p><strong>Dr Simon Thomson</strong> teaches at the Ruhr-Universit�t Bochum.

"He was always so entirely there."<br> Originally published in 1915, Of Human Bondage is a potent expression of the power of sexual obsession and of modern man's yearning for freedom. This classic bildungsroman tells the story of Philip Carey, a sensitive boy born with a clubfoot who is orphaned and raised by a religious aunt and uncle. Philip yearns for adventure, and at eighteen leaves home, eventually pursuing a career as an artist in Paris. When he returns to London to study medicine, he meets the androgynous but alluring Mildred and begins a doomed love affair that will change the course of his life. There is no more powerful story of sexual infatuation, of human longing for connection and freedom.<br> "Here is a novel of the utmost importance," wrote Theodore Dreiser on publication. "It is a beacon of light by which the wanderer may be guided. . . . One feels as though one were sitting before a splendid Shiraz of priceless texture and intricate weave, admiring, feeling, responding sensually to its colors and tones." <br>With an Introduction by Gore Vidal <br>Commentary by Theodore Dreiser and Graham Greene"The modern writer who has influenced me the most." - George Orwell<br>"One of my favourite writers." - Gabriel Garcia Marquez<br>"A writer of great dedication." - Graham Greene</p><h2>Investigation and Prevention of Officer-Involved Deaths</h2><p><p>Each year, too many law enforcement officers die in the line of duty and too many people are killed by the police. Yet, can any of these deaths be avoided? To answer this we must investigate the nature and causes of these deaths in an unbiased and objective manner to highlight and expose weaknesses in policy that can be amended through more rigorous, enlightened, and culture-sensitive training. </p> <p></p> <p>Examining hypothetical cases drawn from the most prevalent and typical officer-involved deaths in recent years, <strong>Investigation and Prevention of Officer-Involved Deaths </strong>reviews the circumstances, relevant discussions, and critical issues for each case type wherein law enforcement officers have had to respond outside of their usual and trained experience and where the final outcome was the death of either the suspect, an innocent bystander, or the officer. </p> <p></p> <p>With a focus on crime scene investigation and the collection and preservation of the relevant forensic evidence, the book outlines appropriate crime scene procedures for each situation and lists potential categories of forensic evidence to be searched for, collected, and submitted to the forensic laboratory for analysis. The authors discuss postmortem protocols, including autopsy reports, toxicological analyses, and other appropriate investigative findings. They then examine policy and training protocols for each, look at the use and potential benefit of less-lethal weapons, and pose the critical question of "what would you do if you were the police officer."</p> <p></p> <p>Through the serious study of each of the categories presented in this book, police officers and other groups of law enforcement officials can more fully comprehend and appreciate the societal significance of such cases. The more aware, sensitive, and well-educated are officers of the law, the more dignified, humane, and safe are the communities they are sworn to serve.</p></p><p>Cyril H.

That&#39;s the premise behind THE HEART OF COUNSELING: A GUIDE TO DEVELOPING THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIPS. By walking you through thirteen concrete and detailed therapeutic relationship skills, Cochran and Cochran give you the best counseling textbook of its kind on the market. It&#39;s easy to understand and loaded with study tools, making it the textbook that prepares you for both career and classroom at the same time.</p><p>Dr. Jeff Cochran&#39;s counseling experiences have ranged from elementary school to universities. He has served as counselor in school, university, and agency settings, and has counseled in several states and overseas. He earned his Ph.D. at Virginia Tech, and his BA and MA at Appalachian State University. His most frequent scholarly interests include Child-Centered Play Therapy (CCPT) and other applications of the Person-Centered approach (PCA); counseling services for children and youth with behavioral and emotional difficulties, such as conduct disorder; and the power and potential of therapeutic relationships. Jeff Cochran teaches the initial practicum course at SUNY-Brockport."I really like this book. I am particularly impressed with the amount of self-reflection encouraged in the text. It's critical that beginning counselors learn to look inward and see how their own experiences and perceptions influence how they relate to clients. The book, better than any other I have seen, encourages that type of deep self-reflection and provides concrete exercises to help guide and structure these inner explorations. This book is an excellent introduction to the most important elements of building a therapeutic relationship. In much detail, it guides students through the major skills and ideas needed to connect with clients in a person-centered way. Additionally, it has strong emphasis on counselor personal awareness and growth, providing many exercises and guidelines to help students become more aware of how their own experiences and perspectives may impact a growing therapeutic relationship."<br><br>"This is an excellent text to use in teaching and supervising counseling students. It is engaging, thorough, and practical. I would welcome the opportunity to use this text because I believe it is unique in its ability to make clear, not just its theoretical perspective, but the practical application of abstract, intangible and absolutely essential counseling skills...I would appreciate having a text like this one to show students that the relationship is key."<br><br>"Vivid, warm and keenly insightful dialogue on the core foundations of therapeutic connection and healing...A humanistic, person-centered journey."</p><h2>International Standby Practices - ISP98 (Letters of Credit)</h2><p>Developed by the Institute of International Banking Law and Practice, endorsed and published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), ISP98 is the standardized text for the use of standby&#39;s worldwide.

A few examples, such as "The Tyger" and "The Chimney Sweeper," frequently appear in anthologies of English literature, in which the poems are often printed without Blake's evocative engravings. But Blake made collections of his <i>Songs, </i>first the <i>Innocence </i>group alone in 1789, and then <i>Experience </i>in 1794, combining the two in that year to make up a single volume.<br><br>This facsimile edition is based on a unique copy in the collection of the Huntington Library that shows how Blake used coloring style and pen and ink additions to make a unified book out of fifty-four individual engravings. Based on new digital photography, this edition also captures the designs and coloring as closely as possible. The plates are followed by a transcription of the poems.<br><br>Robert N. Essick's commentary includes a brief biography of Blake and interprets each poem in dialogue with the other <i>Songs. </i>Essick also explores the political and historical contexts of the poems.

The Reader also supplies up-to-date translations of the Gospel of Thomas, the Didache, the Letter of Barnabas, 1 Clement, and the letters of Ignatius.<br>Broader issues affecting the treatment of these texts open the six sections of literature. Lead articles discuss pseudonymity, church tradition, synoptic sources, epistles as documents, conflicting doctrines, and originating events.<br>Introductions to each individual work discuss the date and place of composition, authorship, audience, basic themes, literary features, and the Jewish and Hellenistic contexts, and they suggest further readings in the secondary literature. Generous notes illumine specific historical, lexical, and interpretive issues.<br>The Early Christian Reader thus offers an objective, informed entree into the complex world of the earliest Christian literature.

In1832 she married a Unitarian minister, WilliamGaskell, and they settled in Manchester. Theindustrial surroundings offered her inspiration forher writings and it was here that she wrote bothCranford (1853) and North and South (1855), aswell as the first biography of Charlotte Bront�.

This Broadview edition makes Hugo&#x2019;s novel available in a completely new English translation, the first in over one hundred years. Set in 1791, during the first months of a slave revolt that would eventually lead to the creation of the black republic of Haiti in 1804, <em>Bug-Jargal</em> is a stirring tale of interracial friendship and rivalry, a provocative account of the ties that bind a young Frenchman to one of the rebel leaders and the tragic misunderstandings that threaten to sever those ties completely. </p> <p> This Broadview edition contains a critical introduction and a broad selection of appendices, including Hugo&#x2019;s never-before-translated 1820 short story &#x201c;Bug-Jargal,&#x201d; contemporary reviews of the novel, documents pertaining to the young Hugo&#x2019;s poetics and politics, and selections from his source materials about the Haitian Revolution. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Chris Bongie</strong> is a Professor of English at Queen&#x2019;s University, Kingston.

Bongie&#x2019;s critical introduction, translations of both the 1826 novel and the original 1820 short story, and incorporation of contemporary reviews, literary sources, and historical materials reinvigorate Hugo&#x2019;s work and enable the reader to engage with it from a fresh, postcolonial perspective.&#x201d; &#x2015; Kathryn M. Grossman, Pennsylvania State University </p> <p> &#x201c;Victor Hugo&#x2019;s early novel of the Haitian Revolution has taken on a new significance in our postcolonial age preoccupied with race, subaltern resistance, and hybridity. Chris Bongie provides a richly contextualized version that will appeal to historians, literary scholars, and general readers alike. It combines meticulous documentation and a provocative argument about the conservative young poet&#x2019;s ambivalent rendering of this &#x2018;struggle of giants,&#x2019; which was written at a turning point in his political development.&#x201d; &#x2015; David Geggus, University of Florida </p> <p> &#x201c;Chris Bongie gives a highly readable and accurate translation of the novel, its 1820 short-story version, and of the supporting documents. He also devotes much of the introduction and notes to demonstrating how Hugo had pieced together portions of the novel from historical sources.

It has transformed the way the field of art history is perceived and experienced. Engaging, accessible, and, just as important, fun, "Art History" gives today's readers cultural and social context for art along with eloquent visual explanations of art's special qualities and particular vocabularies. Its animated and clear narrative tells the many-sided story of art, starting with the earliest prehistoric paintings and sculpture through today's wildly varying works in new mediums. <p> In addition to offering an outstanding collection of color illustrations, "Art History" features glorious maps, chronologies, and scores of labeled line drawings and architectural plans. Special essays called "The Object Speaks" offer tantalizing insights on topics such as authenticity, patronage, and artistic intention. </p><p> Thoroughly updated to reflect the latest in scholarship, this Revised Second Edition features even more works in color and more newly cleaned or restored works. Many works of art are completely new to the book, including a wall painting from Chauvet cave, a page from the Morgan Library Picture Bible, Bronzino's "Allegory with Venus and Cupid," Claude Lorrain's "Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba," Rembrandt's "Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp," and Courbet's "The Stone Breakers," among many others. The addition of cutting edge contemporary artists Jeff Wall and Jennifer Steinkampt, and architect Daniel Libeskind bring present-day currency to the book's scope. More attention has been paid to the art and culture of the Islamic world and specifically the OttomanEmpire.</p><p> <b>Marilyn Stokstad</b>, teacher, art historian, and museum curator, has been a leader in her field for decades and has served as president of the College Art Association and the International Center of Medieval Art.

Through the medium ofdrawing, Afterimage revisits process art in terms of the artists whodefined the movement and suggests a transitional moment when many ofits practitioners anticipated the feminist and postminimalist art ofthe 1970s. Nancy Grossman's use of language, for example, suggests akind of material abstraction, and Nancy Holt's earth works and relateddrawings introduced content into a minimalist vocabulary. The bookalso explores the drawing as a residual object in works in which theprocess of making dictates the form of the drawing. Examples includeGordon Matta-Clark's stacked cuttings, Robert Morris' "blind time"drawings, and Sol Lewitt's folded construction drawings. Other works,such as those by Bruce Nauman and Robert Smithson, record a particularapproach to body-based and process-oriented sculpture. The book, which accompanies an exhibition, contains an essayby Cornelia H. Butler on the historical ambiguity surrounding processart and one by Pamela M. Lee on temporality in work of the late1960s. The artists included in the book are William Anastasi, RichardArtschwager, Mel Bochner, Agnes Denes, Nancy Grossman, RobertGrosvenor, Marcia Hafif, Eva Hesse, Nancy Holt, Barry LeVa, SolLewitt, Lee Lozano, Sylvia Plimack Mangold, Gordon Matta-Clark, RobertMorris, Bruce Nauman, Yvonne Rainer, Dorothea Rockburne, Alan Saret,Joel Shapiro, Robert Smithson, Michelle Stuart, Richard Tuttle, andJack Whitten.Copublished with The Museum of Contemporary Art.

Author Maxie Dunnam believes that the best guidelines for spiritual growth now, as then--and also the strongest defense against the inevitable abuses of that hunger--are found in the practical and perceptive writings of Apostle Paul. Dunnam shows how Paul made his spiritual life &#34;an ongoing reality, not a one-time experience or an occasional occurrence.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Stoicism (Volume 1) (Ancient Philosophies)</h2><p>One of the most popular of the Hellenistic schools of philosophy in antiquity, Stoicism flourished for some five hundred years and has remained a constant presence throughout the history of Western philosophy. Its doctrines appealed to people from all strata of ancient society-from the slave Epictetus to the emperor Marcus Aurelius. This book provides a lucid, comprehensive introduction to this great philosophical school. It gives an overview of the history of the school, covers its philosophy as a system, and explores the three main branches of Stoic theory. John Sellars includes historical information on the life and works of the ancient Stoic philosophers and summaries, analyses, and appraisals of their principal doctrines in logic, physics, and ethics. He also includes a fascinating account of the Stoic legacy from later antiquity to the present. The volume includes a glossary and chronology, which, together with its accessible yet authoritative approach, makes it the ideal choice for students, scholars, and general readers interested in what Stoicism has meant, both philosophically and historically, for western civilization.</p><p>"Stoicism needs a new work of this kind. Sellars not only takes good account of the last thirty years of research, he also has much of his own to contribute. I particularly applaud his focus on Epictetus and on Stoicism as an art of life.&nbsp;"&#x2015;A.A.

A Learning Resource For Jews And Christians: A Learning Resource for Jews and Christians</h2><p>Written by Jewish and Christian educators for use by college and adult learners, this volume explores eight basic questions that lie at the core of both traditions and that can serve as a bridge for understanding. Among the questions are: Do Jews and Christians worship the same God? Do Jews and Christians read the Bible the same way? What is the place of the land of Israel for Jews and Christians? Are the irreconcilable differences between Christians and Jews a blessing, a curse, or both? Each chapter includes discussion questions.</p><p>David Sandmel</p><h2>The Hispanic World in Crisis and Change: 1598 - 1700</h2><p>The seventeenth century has gained enormously from the resurgence of historical studies in Spain and from the contributions of historians outside the penninsula.

It retains its previous framework, and provides a penetrating account of Spanish society, economy, government and politics during this period.</p><p>In this book, now available in paper, John Lynch has substantially revised and expanded his<i> Spain Under the Habsburgs, Volume II,</i> taking account of the research of the last decade and the interests of modern historians. The book retains its previous framework and preserves the character which has made it one of the most quoted works on Spain's century of adversity. It continues to cast a penetrating eye on the regime of Philip III and Lerma, the imperial policies of Philip IV and Olivares, the mid-century revolutions, the chronology of depression, and the balance of progress and poverty under Charles II. And it still provides the most comprehensive and challenging account of the role of America in the Hispanic world and of the changing relations between colonies and metropolis.<b>John Lynch</b> has spent most of his academic career in the University of London, first at University College, then the Institute of Latin-American Studies.

During its seven-minute span we see, again and again, the transformation of the drab secretary Diana Prince into the super-heroic Wonder Woman. By isolating and repeating the moment of transformation&#x2015;spinning figure, arms outstretched&#x2015;Birnbaum unmasks the technology at the heart of the metamorphosis. In this illustrated examination of Birnbaum's video, T. J. Demos situates it in its historical context&#x2015;among other developments in postmodernist appropriation, media analysis, and feminist politics&#x2015;and explores the artist's pioneering attempts to open up the transformative abilities of video as a medium. Demos examines Birnbaum's influence on such artists as Douglas Gordon, Pierre Huyghe, Philippe Parreno, and Candice Breitz, and the turn toward &#x201c;postproduction procedures&#x201d;&#x2015;the mobilization of existing imagery for innovative uses. He also reveals a fascinating historical shift in the reception of Birnbaum's work: a move from an emphasis on her deconstruction of mass culture ideology to an appreciation of her creative use of consumer imagery.</p></p><p>T.

Edgar Hoover&#39;s Ghostreaders Framed African American Literature</h2><p><p><b>How FBI surveillance influenced African American writing</b></p><p>Few institutions seem more opposed than African American literature and J. Edgar Hoover's white-bread Federal Bureau of Investigation. But behind the scenes the FBI's hostility to black protest was energized by fear of and respect for black writing. Drawing on nearly 14,000 pages of newly released FBI files, <i>F.B. Eyes</i> exposes the Bureau&#x2019;s intimate policing of five decades of African American poems, plays, essays, and novels. Starting in 1919, year one of Harlem&#x2019;s renaissance and Hoover&#x2019;s career at the Bureau, secretive FBI "ghostreaders" monitored the latest developments in African American letters. By the time of Hoover&#x2019;s death in 1972, these ghostreaders knew enough to simulate a sinister black literature of their own. The official aim behind the Bureau&#x2019;s close reading was to anticipate political unrest. Yet, as William J. Maxwell reveals, FBI surveillance came to influence the creation and public reception of African American literature in the heart of the twentieth century.</p><p>Taking his title from Richard Wright&#x2019;s poem "The FB Eye Blues," Maxwell details how the FBI threatened the international travels of African American writers and prepared to jail dozens of them in times of national emergency. All the same, he shows that the Bureau&#x2019;s paranoid style could prompt insightful criticism from Hoover&#x2019;s ghostreaders and creative replies from their literary targets. For authors such as Claude McKay, James Baldwin, and Sonia Sanchez, the suspicion that government spy-critics tracked their every word inspired rewarding stylistic experiments as well as disabling self-censorship.</p><p>Illuminating both the serious harms of state surveillance and the ways in which imaginative writing can withstand and exploit it, <i>F.B. Eyes</i> is a groundbreaking account of a long-hidden dimension of African American literature.</p></p><p><p>"Anyone who spies William J. Maxwell's latest book is sure to have her or his eyes pop. <i>F.B. Eyes</i> is a fascinating study of the FBI's decades-long surveillance program targeting the who's who of the African American cultural scene. What we read as art, Hoover's G-Men coded as threats. In poring over black writers' output across the long arc of the civil rights struggle, the FBI's 'ghostreaders,' as diabolical as they were paranoid, added layers of weight to--and in some cases informed--the African American literary canon, which Maxwell reveals in an irresistible narrative steeped in investigative research."<b>--Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Harvard University</b></p><p>"<i>F.B. Eyes</i> is an exciting and important read: part detective story, part intelligence history, and part revisionist theory of black modernism. Throughout, William J. Maxwell proves to be a more rigorous and ingenious 'ghostreader' than Hoover ever was."<b>--Mary Helen Washington, University of Maryland, College Park</b></p><p>"In this meticulously researched study, William J. Maxwell demonstrates how the luminaries of twentieth-century African American literature preoccupied the 'ghostreaders' of Hoover's FBI, who became some of the most assiduous critics of modern black writing. While making clear the abuses of FBI surveillance, Maxwell also illuminates the fascinating ways in which African American authors incorporated a critical awareness of spying into much of the literature they produced."<b>--Kenneth W. Warren, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"Full of surprises of fact and interpretation, often wittily and memorably formulated, this awe-inspiringly well-researched book offers a completely new approach to FBI spying on black writers and to the readerly and scholarly habits of Hoover's G-Men, who perversely come across as rather pioneering critics of African American literature. This book is an absolute delight to read."<b>--Werner Sollors, Harvard University</b></p><p>"This bold, well-written, and witty book makes a valuable contribution to African American and black diasporan literary history and will be an important resource for some time to come. The book reveals, among other things, a pas de deux between the FBI and black authors that had a significant impact on twentieth-century African American writing. William J. Maxwell shows that the FBI's constant surveillance had an influence on black writers and intellectuals that has largely been ignored until now."<b>--George Hutchinson, Cornell University</b></p><b>William J.

On the way, he provides an enriching and entertaining account of the great, the good, and the downright bad in economic theories- from double-entry bookkeeping to game theory.</p><p>Paul Strathern's <i>A Brief History of Economic Genius</i> is a lively and ambitious series of linked biographies of notable visionaries in the world of economics. The cast includes schemers, dreamers, unheeded prophets, utopians, sages, mountebanks, dour pessimists, megalomaniacal optimists, socialists, laissez-faire extremists, mighty eccentrics, and, within their own rights, geniuses of all ranks. Some of these are well known--John Maynard Keynes, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Robert Malthus, George Marshall, and John Nash of <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> fame. Others are obscure: John von Neumann, inspiration for Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove character; Luca Pacioli, "inventor" of double-entry bookkeeping; John Gaunt, the father of statistics; John Law, a good candidate for the title of "richest man in history," who, in the early 18th century, almost single-handedly bankrupted France. Strathern weaves the men's lives and contributions with notable marketplace milestones such as Holland's 17th-century bout of tulipmania, Britain's notorious South Sea Bubble, the Great Depression, and the rebuilding and retribution strategies following the two world wars. <i>A Brief History of Economic Genius</i> is an amiable, measured, delightful, instructive, and, at times, extremely humorous narrative. In Strathern's hands, the "dismal science" becomes anything but. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>Paul Strathern lectures in Philosophy and Mathematics at Kingston University in London.

In <em>Democracy Against Domination</em> , K. Sabeel Rahman draws on a rich tradition of political economy rooted in the thought and reform politics of early twentieth-century progressives like John Dewey and Louis Brandeis to argue that, first, we should reconceive economic governance as focused not just on growth or efficiency but rather on counteracting the threat of domination whether in the form of corporate power or inequitable markets; and second, that we must do so by expanding the capacity of citizens themselves to exercise real political power in economic policymaking. Synthesizing a range of insights from law, history, political theory, and public policy, Rahman combines a fresh normative approach to democratic theory and economic power with a concrete analysis of the institutions needed to realize urgent hopes for a more equitable and democratic economy.<br></p><p><br><strong>K. Sabeel Rahman</strong> is Assistant Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School.<br><br>"The ultimate failure of economic regulation, the author argues, derives from viewing the market's problems as technical problems, to be solved by experts, rather than problems of political domination to be solved by altering democratic institutions. The author finds precedence for his interpretation in the writings of Louis Brandeis and John Dewey. Pragmatic regulation by democratically selected grassroots participants promises better outcomes than elite technocrats selected for their expertise. Summing Up: Highly recommended." --<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"The financial crisis prompted arcane debates about regulatory reform and much public outrage, but little rethinking of how citizens can have a voice in governing the economy - until now. Sabeel Rahman criticizes the managerial, technocratic approach to regulation and offers a morally robust, democratic alternative. The most important book about democracy and the regulatory state since the financial crisis." --Michael Sandel, author of *<p></p><br>"The gods endowed Sabeel Rahman with a democratic soul. Ordinary citizens need not give over the regulatory state to managers and experts. We can combat concentrated power and remoteness from government by boldly redesigning the scale and scope of institutions. Rahman shows that these ideas have deep American roots, and that citizens can own crucial policy decisions, starting right now." --Nancy L. Rosenblum, author of <p></p><br>"Sabeel Rahman is a new, bold, and original voice in the fields of law, history, and political economy. This book brilliantly heeds Walt Whitman's prophetic call in Democratic Vistas for 'a force-infusion of intellect' to confront 'the dominant play of solely materialistic bearings upon current life in the United States.' --William J.

Fried provides an entirely new understanding not only of the art of Manet and his generation but also of the way in which the Impressionist simplification of Manet's achievement had determined subsequent accounts of pictorial modernism down to the present. Like Fried's previous books, <i>Manet's Modernism</i> is a milestone in the historiography of modern art.<br><br>"Beautifully produced. . . . [Fried's] thought is always stimulating, if not provocative.

Danto, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br></p><p>Our current understanding of the paintings of Manet is so heavily filtered through the lens of Impressionism that in many ways, his contributions to art history have been obscured. Called the "first modernist," his paintings marked a break with the past and paved the way for what we've come to accept as modern art in the treatment of the canvas as a flat surface. But during his time, Manet's modernist innovations were the object of ridicule. "It's flat, it isn't modeled," said Courbet of the nude in the painting <i>Olympia.</i> "It's like the Queen of Hearts after a bath." In <i>Manet's Modernism</i>, Michael Fried has set out to see Manet as his contemporaries would have seen him and to gain a more accurate reading of Manet's place in history.Michael Fried is the Herbert Boone Professor of Humanities at the Johns Hopkins University.</p><h2>Bookkeeping Essentials: How to Succeed as a Bookkeeper</h2><p><b>The handy problem-solver with helpful information for today's busy bookkeepers</b> <p><i>Bookkeeping Essentials: How to Succeed as a Bookkeeper</i> is the handy problem-solver that gives today's busy bookkeepers and accountants the helpful information they need in a quick-reference format.

Delicate as a child, he was taught at home by his mother before he attended grammar school. At sixteen, Hardy was apprenticed to an architect, and for many years, architecture was his profession; in his spare time, he pursued his first and last literary love, poetry. Finally convinced that he could earn his living as an author, he retired from architecture, married, and devoted himself to writing.

H. Lawrence&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R&#x2019;s largely autobiographical &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RSons and Lovers&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R tells the story of Paul Morel, a young artist growing into manhood in a British working-class community near the Nottingham coalfields. His mother Gertrude, unhappily married to Paul&#x2019;s hard-drinking father, devotes all her energies to her son. They develop a powerful and passionate relationship, but eventually tensions arise when Paul falls in love with a girl and seeks to escape his family ties. Torn between his desire for independence and his abiding attachment to his loving but overbearing mother, Paul struggles to define himself sexually and emotionally through his relationships with two women&#x2015;the innocent, old-fashioned Miriam Leivers, and the experienced, provocatively modern Clara Dawes. &amp;&amp;LP&amp;&amp;RHeralding Lawrence&#x2019;s mature period, Sons and Lovers vividly evokes the all-consuming nature of possessive love and sexual attraction.

She has worked at <i>The Paris Review</i> and contributed to the <i>Boulder Daily Camera</i>, small literary presses in the United States, and English-language publications in Bangkok, Thailand. She currently lives and works in San Diego, California. <br><b>From Victoria Blake's Introduction to <i>Sons and Lovers</i></b> <p>The story of how and why D.H. Lawrence wrote <i>Sons and Lovers</i> is a love story as much as it is a story about literature. The story begins at D.H. Lawrence's birth and ends just before the outbreak of World War One. Although it is a love story, it is not a story about amor, per se, the exclusive romantic love. Rather, it is about love in all its various guises-love for the Mother Country and the mother, love for the work of writing and, above all, love for life itself. D.H. Lawrence was a passionate man; he threw himself into life. In his presence, his peers were aware of life lived more highly, of emotions felt more truly and of the rawness of human experience. Lawrence took life in huge gulps, personalizing it and, in the end, changing it to suit his own artistic goals. </p><p>"I remember seeing him sitting apart at a table doing matriculation work," writes Jessie Chambers in her book <i>D. H. Lawrence: A Personal Record</i> (see "For Further Reading"). "He smiled across at me, and I saw again his uniqueness, how totally different he was from any of the other youths. . . . There was his sensitiveness . . . his delicacy of spirit, that, while it contributed vitally to his charm, made him more vulnerable, more susceptible to injury from the crudeness of life" (p. 47). </p><p><i>Sons and Lovers</i> is Lawrence's third novel. He began writing it when he was twenty-five years old, a young, sensitive schoolteacher with periodic bouts of pneumonia and a penchant for problems of the heart. The novel underwent four major revisions and a name change before being published in 1913. As conceived, it was to be a book based on fact: the story of the young man, Paul Morel, growing up in a coal-mining district of the English Midlands. As such, it would be a thinly disguised fictionalization of Lawrence's own life, a portrait of the artist as a young man or, as the critic Harold Bloom suggests, a portrait of the artist as a young prig. </p><p>Lawrence was born in 1885 in a lower-middle-class town in Nottinghamshire during a time in English history characterized by repressive social mores, strict morality, and austere, even ascetic, religious practices. In other words, the author was born at a time and in a place particularly inclined toward priggishness. </p><p>Lawrence chaffed under the yoke of Victorian England. His gift of perception, which told him that life was a vast mystery and wonder, also told him that his country was ruining itself with its industrialization, its mechanization, and its impulse toward war. As he grew up, he grew intolerant. "Curse you, my countrymen," he wrote to Edward Garnett, his publisher and friend, in a letter dated July 1912, "you have put the halters round your necks, and pull tighter and tighter from day to day. You are strangling yourselves, you blasted fools" (<i>The Letters of D. H. Lawrence</i>, Vol. 1, edited by James T. Boulton). To borrow Lawrence's own phrase, England suffered under a "Thou Shalt Not" mentality. </p><p>Lawrence longed for the implied permission of the "Thou Shalt," two words that promise not only freedom but also free will. The purpose of life, Lawrence wrote, was not simply to live, but to live vitally and at the edge of the great mystery of existence. This will to live-or, perhaps more correctly, the will toward life-was, in a characteristically Lawrencian sense, mixed up with a philosophy of sex. With more emotion than logic, Lawrence felt that "Thou Shalt," when murmured by a partially clothed woman, promised not only sexual union but also spiritual union. His philosophy is not simply, as future critics would categorize it, "sex in the head." What Lawrence wanted was not crude, not base, not purely sexual. "It's a pity that sex is such an ugly little word," Lawrence wrote in an essay titled "Sex Versus Loveliness." "While ever it lives, the fire of sex, which is the source of beauty and anger, burns in us beyond our understanding. . . . Sex and beauty are one thing, like flame and fire. If you hate sex, you hate beauty." Lawrence wanted, through sex, to understand beauty and through beauty, mystery. It was this understanding that Lawrence defined as intuition, and it was this intuition that Lawrence felt to be his prime talent as a writer. </p><p>And it is a pity that sex was such a dirty little word in Victorian England, though for admirers of Lawrence it would be hard to wish it otherwise. The most subtle, almost sublime, tensions in his writing owe much to the war between his second-natural will to live and his natural desire to obey. <i>Sons and Lovers</i> is the work of a confused man, one who could not figure out which impulse to follow. As in life, so in fiction. In <i>Sons and Lovers</i>, the two impulses are represented on the one side by Paul Morel's relationship with his mother and on the other side by his relationship with first Miriam, then Clara. In a much-quoted letter written to Edward Garnett dated November 1912, Lawrence defends the idea of the book, succinctly illuminating its themes. </p><p>A woman of character and refinement goes into the lower class, and has no satisfaction in her own life. She has had a passion for her husband, so the children are born of passion, and have heaps of vitality. But as her sons grow up she selects them as lovers-first the eldest, then the second. These sons are urged into life by their reciprocal love of their mother-urged on and on. But when they come to manhood, they can't love, because their mother is the strongest power in their lives, and holds them. . . . As soon as the young men come into contact with women, there's a split. William gives his sex to a fribble, and his mother holds his soul. But the split kills him, because he doesn't know where he is. The next son gets a woman who fights for his soul-fights his mother. The son loves the mother-all the sons hate and are jealous of the father. The battle goes on between the mother and the girl, with the son as object. The mother gradually proves stronger, because of the tie of blood. The son decides to leave his soul in his mother's hands, and, like his elder brother, go for passion. He gets passion. Then the split begins to tell again. But, almost unconsciously, the mother realizes what is the matter, and begins to die. The son casts off his mistress, attends to his mother dying. He is left in the end naked of everything, with the drift toward death (Letters). </p><p>Since Freud, mother love versus romantic love has become a familiar theme. Hundreds of pages, perhaps thousands, have been written about Lawrence's Oedipus complex as demonstrated in the novel. Critics began to see the novel in a Freudian light as early as 1913; <i>Sons and Lovers</i> was taken to be the first, great, Freudian allegory. "As he stooped to kiss his mother, she threw her arms round his neck, hid her face on his shoulder, and cried, in a whimpering voice, so unlike her own that he writhed in agony," Lawrence wrote. "'And I've never-you know, Paul-I've never had a husband-not really-'" Mrs. Morel says. Paul "stroked his mother's hair, and his mouth was on her throat." </p><p>Although Lawrence was aware of Freudian ideas as early as 1912, there is no indication that he intended the book to have a Freudian subtext. Responding to the Freudian interpretation, he thought the critics had carved a half lie from an honest portrayal of his childhood. He saw what he had written as a novel, not a case history, and considered the text universal, a representation of "the tragedy of thousands of young men in England" (from the Garnett letter of November 1912). Later, in 1921, he published an anti-Freudian tract titled <i>Psychoanalysis and the Unconscious</i>. </p><p>However, Lawrence admitted in various letters that he had loved his mother like a lover. He wrote descriptions of Mrs. Lawrence as if he were writing about a girlfriend: "She is my first, great love. She was a wonderful, rare woman-you do not know; as strong, and steadfast, and generous as the sun. She could be as swift as a white whiplash, and as kind and gentle as warm rain, and as steadfast as the irreducible earth beneath us," he wrote to Louise Burrows in December 1910, on the eve of his mother's death (Letters). In the same month he wrote to Rachel Ann and Taylor, "This has been a kind of bond between me and my mother. We have loved each other, almost with a husband and wife love, as well as filial and maternal." Later in the same letter he wrote, "Nobody can have the soul of me. My mother has had it, and nobody can have it again. Nobody can come into my very self again, and breath me like an atmosphere" (Letters). </p><p>This, then, is the setting for the composition of <i>Sons and Lovers</i>. A remarkably gifted young man, tragically stifled under both the yoke of his mother's love and the weight of Victorian morals, conceives of an autobiographical novel that will stick to the facts of his upbringing. Eastwood, the rundown though respectable mining town where Lawrence was born, changes to Bestwood. Lydia Lawrence, his mother, changes to Gertrude Morel. And Lawrence, with little change, renames himself Paul.</p></p><h2>Evictions: Art and Spatial Politics (Graham Foundation / MIT Press Series in Contemporary Architectural Discourse)</h2><p><p>Since the 1980s a great deal has been written on the relationship between art, architecture, and urban planning and design, on the one hand, and the politics of space on the other. In <i>Evictions </i>Rosalyn Deutsche investigates&#x2015;and protests against&#x2015;the dominant uses of this interdisciplinary discourse. Deutsche argues that critics on both the left and the right invoke harmonious images of space that conceal and justify exclusions&#x2015;whether the space in question is a city, park, institution, exhibition, identity, or work of art. By contrast, she calls for a democratic spatial critique that takes account of the conflicts that produce and maintain all spaces, including the space of politics itself. <i>Evictions</i> examines how aesthetic and urban ideologies were combined during the last decade to legitimize urban redevelopment programs that claimed to be beneficial to all, yet in reality tried to expunge traditional working classes from the city. Combining critical aesthetic theory about the social production of art with critical urban theory about the social production of space, Deutsche exposes this unspoken agenda. She then responds to a new alliance of prominent urban and cultural scholars who use critical spatial theory to protect traditional left political projects against the challenges posed by new radical cultural practices. In her critique, Deutsche mobilizes feminist and postmodern ideas about the politics of visual representation and subjectivity. She also intervenes in debates taking place in art, architecture, and urban studies about the meaning of public space, and places these struggles within broader contests over the definition of democracy. Opposing the nostalgic belief that democracy's survival demands the recovery of a once unified public sphere, Deutsche contends that conflict, far from undermining public space, is a prerequisite for its existence and growth.</p><p><b>Contents</b><br>Introduction � I.

This greatly expands the range and complexity of problems that students can effectively study in the course. Since DSP applications are primarily algorithms implemented on a DSP processor or software, a fair amount of programming is required. Using interactive software such as MATLAB makes it possible to place more emphasis on learning new and difficult concepts than on programming algorithms.

But why? And are they right? Is a taste for luxury fundamentally misguided? If one has the means to be a spendthrift, is it foolish or reprehensible to be extravagant?</p><p>In this book<i>, </i>Emrys Westacott examines why, for more than two millennia, so many philosophers and people with a reputation for wisdom have been advocating frugality and simple living as the key to the good life. He also looks at why most people have ignored them, but argues that, in a world facing environmental crisis, it may finally be time to listen to the advocates of a simpler way of life.</p><p><i>The Wisdom of Frugality </i>explores what simplicity means, why it's supposed to make us better and happier, and why, despite its benefits, it has always been such a hard sell. The book looks not only at the arguments in favor of living frugally and simply, but also at the case that can be made for luxury and extravagance, including the idea that modern economies require lots of getting and spending.</p><p>A philosophically informed reflection rather than a polemic, <i>The Wisdom of Frugality </i>ultimately argues that we will be better off&#x2015;as individuals and as a society&#x2015;if we move away from the materialistic individualism that currently rules.</p></p><p><p>"In this book, Emrys Westacott delves into the conflict between the virtues of the simple life and the apparently irresistible economic imperative to grow. Economic growth has brought us longer, healthier, and more comfortable and varied lives. But Westacott makes the case that, given our present situation, the appeal of frugality is not mere nostalgia, but rather the route to a more meaningful way of life."<b>--Diane Coyle, author of <i>The Economics of Enough</i></b></p><p>"This profoundly thoughtful philosophical examination of frugality provides a thorough investigation of both simple and luxurious living. Emrys Westacott gives philosophical, psychological, religious, and economic arguments for and against frugality, and he has convinced me that the case for it is more complicated and more interesting than I had thought."<b>--William B. Irvine, author of <i>A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</i></b></p><p>"What I especially like about [<i>The Wisdom of Frugality</i>] is the path Westacott lays out. He's teaching and preaching at the same time. He's an advocate for simple living but his research explores both the pros and cons of frugality. He gets you thinking about so many important questions."<b>--Michelle Singletary,<i>Washington Post</i></b></p><b>Emrys Westacott</b> is professor of philosophy at Alfred University in New York.</p><h2>The Princess of Cl�ves: A Norton Critical Edition (Norton Critical Editions)</h2><p><p><strong><em>The Princess of Cleves</em>, often called the first modern French novel, was published anonymously in 1678 and was received with enthusiasm by its contemporary audience.</strong></p> The text of this Norton Critical Edition is that of Thomas Sargent Perry's 1892 translation, indisputably the translation that has best served readers in English.

In its first two editions (1986, 1991), Acupuncture in the Treatment of Children became the leading English-language textbook in this field. In this broadly expanded third edition, the authors explore a number of new topics and revisit many of the old ones with fresh perspective. In addition to the thirty subjects covered in earlier editions are sixteen new chapters which examine a wide variety of topics, from basic childhood patterns, puberty and the stages of development, immunizations, and learning difficulties to hayfever, hyperactivity and attention deficit disorder, autism, Down&#39;s syndrome, cerebral palsy and infantile paralysis. There is a new outline of patterns commonly seen in children, and an extensive survey of pediatric symptoms and disorders that are treatable with acupuncture. The focus of this third edition is squarely on the problems of treating children in the Western clinic. New patterns that are unique to the lifestyles of children in the West-and new wrinkles on old patterns-are presented candidly and with a refreshing lack of jargon. There are also many new case histories sprinkled throughout the text, bringing theory down to earth.</p><p>Julian Scott, Ph.D., B.Ac., Cert. Ac. (China), studied physics at Cambridge University. After working in industry, he pursued acupuncture studies at the International College of Oriental Medicine (England) from 1973-76 and then at the Nanjing College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 1982. Julian has been treating children for more than twenty years. He is the author of Natural Medicine for Children and Natural Medicine for Women. <p>Teresa Barlow, B.S., B.Ac., studied biochemistry at York University (England). From 1986-89 she studied acupuncture at the International College of Oriental Medicine and in China, and then did further training in pediatrics in 1991. Since that time Teresa has made children the focus of her practice. </p><p>Together, Julian and Teresa have developed a gentle approach to Chinese medicine designed specifically for Western families. They founded the Seattle Pediatric Acupuncture Center, a clinic devoted to promotion of natural healthcare for children utilizing acupuncture supplemented by other therapies such as herbs, homeopathy, and diet. They have also established pediatric clinics in England and Israel. </p><p>Julian and Teresa are devoted to teaching pediatrics to other practitioners so that they may improve their skills and develop their own pediatric practices. To that end, they teach courses in pediatric acupuncture in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Israel.</p>"A superb example of how a clinical textbook should be both written and presented." -- <i>The Journal of Chinese Medicine</i><br><br>"Provides a wealth of easy-to-read, easy-to-use information." -- <i>Journal of Traditional Acupuncture</i></p><h2>Marxism and anthropology: The history of a relationship (Marxist introductions)</h2><p>This book examines the uses made of anthropology by Marx and Engels, and the uses made of Marxism by anthropologists. Looking at the writings of Marx and Engels on primitive societies, the book evaluates their views in the light of present knowledge and draws attention to inconsistencies in their analysis of pre-capitalist societies. These inconsistencies can be traced to the influence of contemporary anthropologists who regarded primitive societies as classless. As Marxist theory was built around the idea of class, without this concept the conventional Marxist analysis foundered.<br> First published in 1983.</p><p></p><h2>Nuclear Medicine: The Requisites (Requisites in Radiology)</h2><p><p><b>Get the essential tools you need to make an accurate diagnosis</b> with<b> <i>Nuclear Medicine: The Requisites!</i></b> The newest edition of his bestselling volume by Drs.

The novel chronicles the tragic decline of a Dutch merchant isolated in 19th-century Borneo, the machinations of his bitter Malayan wife, and the loss of his much loved daughter. Conrad establishes the themes of betrayal, isolation, and colonialism that he would explore throughout the rest of his life and work. Joseph Conrad was a Polish-born novelist who spent most of his adult life in Britain. He is regarded as one of the greatest English novelists, which is even more notable because he did not learn to speak English well until he was in his 20s. Conrad is recognized as a master prose stylist. Some of his works have a strain of romanticism, but more importantly he is recognized as an important forerunner of Modernist literature. Writing during the apogee of the British Empire, Conrad drew upon his experiences in the British Merchant Navy. In 1894, at the age of 36, he left the sea to become an English author. His first novel, Almayer&#x2019;s Folly, set on the east coast of Borneo and was published in 1895. Conrad&#x2019;s narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many writers, including Ernest Hemingway, D.H. Lawrence, Graham Greene, William S. Burroughs, Joseph Heller, John Maxwell Coetzee as well as Jerzy Kosinski and inspired such films as Apocalypse Now (drawn from Heart of Darkness). Joseph Conrad died of a heart attack, and was interred in Canterbury Cemetery, Canterbury, England.</p><p>Set in eastern Borneo during the 1880s, Almayer&#39;s Folly recreates the conflicts of imperial Europe with the colonized East Indies. This edition, first published in 1994, presents Joseph Conrad&#39;s first novel freed from seven layers of publishers&#39; and typists&#39; corruptions.

With high and rising rates of divorce, drug abuse, youth violence, alcoholism, teen promiscuity, and so forth, we cannot afford to let this issue go unexamined.To cling to the idea that what we, as a culture, are doing now is the right and best way for all children simply because it is what we are used to is to shut our eyes and minds to other possibilities-possibilities that may well afford greater happiness, success, peace, and safety to our own children.At a time when people feel more disconnected than ever before, we cannot afford to overlook or allow ourselves to be blinded to an option which offers great benefits, including a rich, fulfilling, and healthy social life, that our children may well need for the future. Homeschooling offers great social benefits to kids and parents. And when we understand them, our children are the ones who will win.</p><p><b>From Library Journal</b> <p>In his sociological study Kingdom of Children: Culture and Controversy in the Homeschooling Movement , Mitchell L. Stevens divides homeschoolers into two groups: those from the Christian day-school movement and those from the alternative school movement. First-time author Gathercole seems to be one of the latter and has here assembled the most common questions regarding the social aspects of homeschooling (e.g., "Don't the kids miss out on socialization?") and answers based in opinion, fact, and personal accounts from homeschoolers and their children. This formula works. Gathercole persuasively argues that homeschooling is not isolating but can be a sophisticated approach to socializing and educating children. The personal accounts especially challenge our cultural construct that school life is synonymous with childhood. While considering the social benefits of homeschooling, Gathercole also illuminates contemporary problems with public education. With a short list of web and print resources, this is not a how-to book, however. It is a successful albeit repetitious and elementary consideration of the topic intended for families in the initial stages of investigating homeschooling.

The well-dressed throng of moviegoers has vanished; the facades are boarded. In <i>Silent Screens,</i> photographer Michael Putnam captures these once prominent cinemas in decline and transformation. His photographs of abandoned movie houses and forlorn marquees are an elegy to this disappearing cultural icon. </p><p>In the early 1980s, Putnam began photographing closed theaters, theaters that had been converted to other uses (a church, a swimming pool), theaters on the verge of collapse, theaters being demolished, and even vacant lots where theaters once stood. The result is an archive of images, large in quantity and geographically diffuse. Here is what has become of the Odeons, Strands, and Arcadias that existed as velvet and marble outposts of Hollywood drama next to barbershops, hardware stores, and five-and-dimes. </p><p>Introduced by Robert Sklar, the starkly beautiful photographs are accompanied by original reminiscences on moviegoing by Peter Bogdanovich, Molly Haskell, Andrew Sarris, and Chester H. Liebs as well as excerpts from the works of poet John Hollander and writers Larry McMurtry and John Updike. Sklar begins by mapping the rise and fall of the local movie house, tracing the demise of small-town theaters to their role as bit players in the grand spectacle of Hollywood film distribution. "Under standard distribution practice," he writes, "a new film took from six months to a year to wend its way from picture palace to Podunk (the prints getting more and more frayed and scratched along the route). Even though the small-town theaters and their urban neighborhood counterparts made up the majority of the nation's movie houses, their significance, in terms of revenue returned to the major motion-picture companies that produced and distributed films, was paltry."</p><p>In his essay, "Old Dreams," <i>Last Picture Show</i> director Peter Bogdanovich recalls the closing of New York City's great movie palaces&#x2015;the mammoth Roxy, the old Paramount near Times Square, the Capitol, and the Mayfair&#x2015;and the more innocent time in which they existed "when a quarter often bought you two features, a newsreel, a comedy short, a travelogue, a cartoon, a serial, and coming attractions."</p><p>While the images in Putnam's book can be read as a metaphor for the death of many downtowns in America, <i>Silent Screens</i> goes beyond mere nostalgia to tell the important story of the disappearance of the single-screen theater, illuminating the layers of cultural and economic significance that still surround it.</p><p>"These photographs and the loss of which they speak signal the passing of a way of being together." &#x2015;Molly Haskell</p><p>List of Theaters by State</p><p>Alabama � The Lyric, Anniston � The Martin, Huntsville</p><p><i>Arizona </i>� The Duncan, Duncan</p><p><i>Arkansas </i>� The Avon, West Memphis</p><p><i>California </i>� The Town, Los Angeles � El Capitan, San Francisco � The State, Santa Barbara</p><p><i>Connecticut </i>� The Dixwell Playhouse, New Haven � The Princess, New Haven</p><p><i>Florida </i>� The Gateway, Lake City</p><p><i>Georgia </i>� The Judy, Hartwell</p><p><i>Idaho </i>� The Ace, Wendell</p><p><i>Illinois </i>� The Pekin, Pekin</p><p><i>Indiana </i>� The Rem, Remington � The Ritz, Rensselaer</p><p><i>Kansas </i>� The Cameo, Kansas City</p><p><i>Kentucky </i>� The Crescent, Louisville � The Ohio, Louisville</p><p><i>Louisiana </i>� The Madison, Madisonville � The Sabine, Many � The Jefferson, New Orleans</p><p><i>Massachusetts </i>� The Strand, Westfield<i>Michigan </i>� The Liberty, Benton Harbor</p><p><i>Mississippi </i>� The Magee, Magee � The Star, Mendenhall � The Mono, Monticello � The Park, Pelahatchie</p><p><i>Missouri </i>� The Star, Warrensburg</p><p><i>Nebraska </i>� The Grand, Grand Isle</p><p><i>New Jersey </i>� RKO Proctor's Palace, Newark</p><p><i>New Mexico </i>� The Lux, Grants � The State, San Jon</p><p><i>New York </i>� The Hollywood, Au Sable Forks � The Broadway, Buffalo � The Lovejoy, Buffalo � The Senate, Buffalo � The Jefferson, New York City � The Little Carnegie, New York City � The 72nd Street East, New York City</p><p><i>North Carolina </i>� The Colonial, Chesnee � The Alva, Morganton</p><p><i>Oregon </i>� The United Artists, Pendleton</p><p><i>Pennsylvania </i>� The Lawndale, Philadelphia � The Rex, Philadelphia � The Spruce, Philadelphia � The York, Philadelphia � The Capitol, Williamsport</p><p><i>Tennessee </i>� The Park, Memphis</p><p><i>Texas </i>� The Royal, Archer City � The Strand, Chillicothe � The Gem, Claude � The Mulkey, Clarendon � The Texas, Del Rio � The Bowie, Fort Worth � The Chatmas, Hearne � The Queen, Hearne � The Palace, Henderson � The Alabama, Houston � The Almeda, Houston � The Crim, Kilgore � The Gulf, Robstown � The Clinch, Tazwell � The Winnie, Winnie</p><p><i>Virginia </i>� The Earle, Big Stone Gap � The Home, Strasburg</p><p> <i>Washington </i>� The Pasco, Pasco</p><p><i>West Virginia </i>� The Ritz, Ansted � The Alpine, Rainelle</p></p><p><p>Starkly beautiful photos of abandoned and converted movie theaters &#x2015; with new essays by Peter Bogdanovich, Molly Haskell, Andrew Sarris, and Chester H.

Born in Havana, Cuba, Morell came to the United States as a teenager in 1962 and later studied photography, earning an MFA from Yale University. He gained attention for intimate, black-and-white pictures of domestic objects from a child&#x2019;s point of view, inspired by the birth of his son in 1986, as well as images in which he turns a room into a giant camera obscura, projecting exterior views onto interior spaces; and photographs of books that revel in their sensory materiality.</p><p>In more recent years, he has turned to color, exploring the camera obscura with a painterly delight and innovating a tent camera that projects outdoor scenes onto a textured ground. Across his career, Morell has approached photography with remarkable wit and creativity, examining everyday objects with childlike curiosity. The first in-depth treatment in fifteen years, this handsome and important book examines Morell&#x2019;s career to the present day, including his earlier works in black-and-white and never before published color photographs from the past decade. An essay by Elizabeth Siegel, along with a recent interview with the artist and an illustrated chronology of his life and works, offers a riveting portrait of this contemporary photographer and his ongoing artistic endeavors.</p></p><p><p>Contemporary artist Abelardo Morell and his imaginative photographs are the subject&nbsp;of this&nbsp;riveting retrospective.</p><p><b>Elizabeth Siegel</b> is associate curator of photography at the Art Institute of Chicago.</p></p><h2>Harvesting the Biosphere: What We Have Taken from Nature (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>An interdisciplinary and quantitative account of human claims on the biosphere's stores of living matter, from prehistoric hunting to modern energy production.</b></p><p>The biosphere&#x2015;the Earth's thin layer of life&#x2015;dates from nearly four billion years ago, when the first simple organisms appeared. Many species have exerted enormous influence on the biosphere's character and productivity, but none has transformed the Earth in so many ways and on such a scale as <i>Homo sapiens</i>. In <i>Harvesting the Biosphere</i>, Vaclav Smil offers an interdisciplinary and quantitative account of human claims on the biosphere's stores of living matter, from prehistory to the present day. Smil examines all harvests&#x2015;from prehistoric man's hunting of megafauna to modern crop production&#x2015;and all uses of harvested biomass, including energy, food, and raw materials. Without harvesting of the biomass, Smil points out, there would be no story of human evolution and advancing civilization; but at the same time, the increasing extent and intensity of present-day biomass harvests are changing the very foundations of civilization's well-being.</p><p>In his detailed and comprehensive account, Smil presents the best possible quantifications of past and current global losses in order to assess the evolution and extent of biomass harvests.

Expansive, ecstatic, original in ways that continue to startle and to elicit new discoveries, Whitman&#x2019;s poetry is a testament to the surging energies of 19th-century America and a monument to the transforming power of literary genius. His incantatory rhythms, revolutionary sense of Eros, and generous, all-embracing vision invite renewed wonder at each reading. Although he has been a defining influence for many poets&#x2014;Garcia Lorca, Fernando Pessoa, Robinson Jeffers, and Allen Ginsberg&#x2014;his style is ultimately inimitable, and his achievement unsurpassed in American poetry.<br><br>&#x201c;One always wants to start out fresh with Whitman,&#x201d; writes Harold Bloom in his introduction, &#x201c;and read him as though he never has been read before.&#x201d; In a selection that ranges from early notebook fragments and the complete &#x201c;Song of Myself&#x201d; to the valedictory &#x201c;Good-bye My Fancy!,&#x201d; Bloom has chosen 47 works to represent &#x201c;the principal writer that America&#x2014;North, Central, or South&#x2014;has brought to us.&#x201d;<br><br><b>About the American Poets Project</b><br>Elegantly designed in compact editions, printed on acid-free paper, and textually authoritative, the American Poets Project makes available the full range of the American poetic accomplishment, selected and introduced by today&#x2019;s most discerning poets and critics.</p><p>Walt Whitman was born in 1819.

However, since the late 1970s textual scholars, critics and editors have argued that there is no single 'King Lear' text. Anyone studying the play needs to be aware of two different texts, one based on the quarto of 1608, The History of King Lear, and a revised version published in the first folio of 1623, The Tragedy of King Lear. This edition offers a fully annotated, modern spelling version of the texts set side by side, identifying and elucidating the major discrepancies between the two. It presents some possible reasons for the differences between the two texts, which themselves shed light on a number of issues relating to literary transmission in the Renaissance and give an insight into the nature of performance and censorship.</p></p><p><p>General Editors: </p> <p>Charlotte Brewer, Hertford College, Oxford<br>H.

However, the existence of the play in two distinct versions - the Quarto of 1608 and the Folio of 1623 - has also provided a fascinating puzzle for generations of scholars. How do differences in Quarto and Folio alter our understanding of the play and affect the way it is performed? Did censorship lie behind major textual absences in Folio? And what can we infer about Shakespeare&#x2019;s working practices from the two versions? </p> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <p>This edition of <i>King Lear</i> provides fully annotated, modern-spelling versions of the Quarto and Folio texts of the play, printed in parallel on facing pages.

Landing on the remote Alaska island of Attu, they assailed an entire village, holding the Alaskan villagers for two months and eventually corralling all survivors into a freighter bound for Japan.<br> One of those survivors, Nick Golodoff, became a prisoner of war at just six years old. He was among the dozens of Unangan Attu residents swept away to Hokkaido, and one of only twenty-five to survive. <i>Attu Boy</i> tells Golodoff&#x2019;s story of these harrowing years as he found both friendship and cruelty at the hands of the Japanese. It offers a rare look at the lives of civilian prisoners and their captors in WWII-era Japan. It also tells of Golodoff&#x2019;s bittersweet return to a homeland torn apart by occupation and forced internments. Interwoven with other voices from Attu, this richly illustrated memoir is a testament to the struggles, triumphs, and heartbreak of lives disrupted by war.</p><p>Except for his imprisonment in Japan, <b>Nick Golodoff </b>(1935&#x2013;2013) lived his life in the Aleutian Islands. <b>Rachel Mason</b> is a cultural anthropologist for the National Park Service in Anchorage, Alaska.&nbsp;<br><i>Attu Boy: A Young Alaskan&#x2019;s WWII Memoir</i> is the firsthand account of Nick Golodoff, a six-year-old Unangan boy who survived the invasion and three years as a Japanese prisoner of war in Otaru on Hokkaido Island.... <i>Attu Boy</i> is a fundamental text for any scholar of Alaska, Alaska Natives, WWII in the Pacific, and the field of Indigenous studies.

This big book on such a very narrowly defined subject is all about providing the angler with a vast amount of information on a single order of insect: Ephemeroptera, the mayflies. Who will benefit from <i>Mayflies</i>? In the authors' own words, it is "written for the novice and expert fly fishers who wish to understand the fundamentals of mayfly entomology and how to effectively fish mayfly species inhabiting the trout waters of North America." To this end, there are chapters on the mayfly's life cycle (with in-depth discussions of each phase, from nymph to emerger to dun to spinner), detailed sections on many common species, and instructions for the fly tier. Drawings, photos, charts, graphs, and an attractive layout enhance the considerable descriptive and scientific text. In all, this is an exhaustive study that should provide serious anglers with useful and fascinating information for those difficult hours spent off the water.This really is the new Bible on mayflies. It's more than a step forward in fly-fishing knowledge. It leaps over the old reliable compendia on mayflies to include all the latest information from anglers and professional entomologists alike. This book will be the fly fisher's key to success with all the great mayfly hatches on North American trout waters. Backed by an amazing body of scientific research, the authors explain everything about the major mayfly species - where, when, and how they emerge and lay eggs - and then describe the best angling tactics and prescribe the best imitations for fishing all the life stages of these important insects.<br></p><h2>Gandhi and Beyond: Nonviolence for a New Political Age</h2><p>Is there room for nonviolence in a time of conflict and mass violence exacerbated by economic crisis? Drawing on the legend and lessons of Gandhi, Cortright traces the history of nonviolent social activism through the twentieth century to the civil rights movement, the Vietnam era, and up to the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Gaza. Gandhi and Beyond offers a critical evaluation and refinement of Gandhi&#39;s message, laying the foundation for a renewed and deepened dedication to nonviolence as the universal path to social progress. In the second edition of this popular book, a new prologue and concluding chapter situate the message of nonviolence in recent events and document the effectiveness of nonviolent methods of political change. Cortright&#39;s poignant &#34;Letter to a Palestinian Student&#34; points toward a radical new strategy for achieving justice and peace in the Middle East. This book offers pathways of hope not only for a new American presidential administration but for the world.</p><p><b>David Cortright</b> is Chair of the Board of Directors for the Fourth Freedom Forum and the Director of Policy Studies at the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame. His most recent book is <i>Towards Nuclear Zero</i>, written with Raimo V�yrynen (2010).&#x201c;David Cortright is a life-long activist and respected scholar. In Gandhi and Beyond, he convincingly shows the power of nonviolence as a philosophy of life, not just a method of social action. His practical analysis of Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Dorothy Day, Cesar Chavez, and others brings new insights and inspiration to those of us attempting to live that philosophy, and to those, especially a new generation, who are seeking a better way to respond to their world. I commend this book to all who are seeking an alternative to violence.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Jim Wallis, author of God&#x2019;s Politics and editor of Sojourners <br> <br>&#x201c;Gandhi and Beyond is a marvelous book, admirably researched and accessibly written, suitable for courses in nonviolence and peace studies, or for anyone wanting to learn more about this crucially important topic.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;David P. Barash, University of Washington, author of Peace and Conflict Studies, Approaches to Peace, and Understanding Violence <br> <br>&#x201c;In Gandhi and Beyond veteran nonviolence activist David Cortright pulls together some important lessons from the recent history of the nonviolence movement. He gives us a strong new interpretation of Mahatma Gandhi&#x2019;s teachings, looks at the legacy of U.S. thinker-activists like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Dorothy Day, and Barbara Deming, and draws heavily on his own experience as an antiwar organizer, too. Cortright&#x2019;s clear exposition of the big themes of nonviolent activism could not be more timely. The tsunami of hyper-militarization that held much of the United States in its grip in the years right after 9/11 has finally started to recede, leaving more questions than before about how people can respond effectively and in nonviolent ways to the violence of our age, and how we can build a better world that &#x2018;takes away the cause for war.&#x2019; Cortright helps provide some good answers.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Helena Cobban, columnist, Christian Science Monitor <br> <br>&#x201c;David Cortright presents an overview of nonviolence that is warm yet critical, theoretical yet practical, historical and also transcontinental. Scholars and practitioners of peaceful struggle will profit from it and also enjoy it.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Rajmohan Gandhi, grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, Visiting Professor, University of Illinois <br> <br>&#x201c;A useful and important book &#x2013; the world would be a better place if Gandhi and Beyond were required reading at every church, high school, and university in the country. Why? Because Cortright has managed to explain in 221 pages how to transform nonviolent action from an admirable ideal to an effective vehicle for social change. If that&#x2019;s not essential material for our movement, I don&#x2019;t know what is.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Sojourners <br> <br>&#x201c;Cortright gives us some practical tools and encourages us to try new, creative, and sometimes more risky, nonviolence methods...What we need in the struggle is persistence and hope according to Cortright.

Now this Ninth Edition of Fundamentals of College Algebra has been improved in three important ways. First, discussions have been rewritten to enable students to more easily understand the mathematical concepts presented. Second, exercises have been added that require students to estimate, approximate, interpret a result, write a summary, create a model, explore, or find a generalization. Third, graphing calculators have been incorporated to a greater extent through the addition of examples and exercises as well as the inclusion of a cross-referenced appendix on the use of the TI 82/83. All of this has been accomplished without compromising the mathematical integrity that is the hallmark of this text.</p><p>Earl Swokowski authored multiple editions of numerous successful textbooks, including CALCULUS; CALCULUS OF A SINGLE VARIABLE; FUNDAMENTALS OF COLLEGE ALGEBRA; and PRECALCULUS: FUNCTIONS AND GRAPHS, all published by Cengage Learning Brooks/Cole.&#34;The clarity of the presentation is wonderful. The examples are well-chosen and to the point. The logical flow of the ideas is beautifully paced and perfectly connected.&#34; &#34;Ah the exercises. Such expanse, such variety....

New linguistic findings have led to a significant shift in emphasis, which is now reflected in this last volume of the <em>Oxford History of England</em>.

I wanted to see in what ratios people were wearing such masks. I was trying to determine, consciously and unconsciously, what people do in response. So, among people walking along the roadway, and people on motorbikes, I saw no one with masks. Even among the official crossing guards outfitted with yellow flags and banners, none. All showed bright and calm. What was I hoping for exactly? The guilty conscience again. But then it was time for school to start. We began to see groups of kids on their way to school. They were wearing masks."<br><br><i>Horses, Horses, in the End the Light Remains Pure</i> is a multifaceted literary response to the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown that devastated northeast Japan on March 11, 2011. The novel is narrated by Hideo Furukawa, who travels back to his childhood home near Fukushima after 3/11 to reconnect with a place that is now doubly alien. His ruminations conjure the region's storied past, particularly its thousand-year history of horses, humans, and the struggle with a rugged terrain. Standing in the morning light, these horses also tell their stories, heightening the sense of liberation, chaos, and loss that accompanies Furukawa's rich recollections. A fusion of fiction, history, and memoir, this book plays with form and feeling in ways reminiscent of Vladimir Nabokov's <i>Speak, Memory</i> and W. G. Sebald's <i>The Rings of Saturn</i> yet draws its own, unforgettable portrait of personal and cultural dislocation.</p><p>In the first major literary response to the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear meltdown that devastated northeast Japan in 2011, Furukawa travels back to his childhood home near Fukushima to assess the damage and reconnect with a place that is now doubly alien.

So how can you know who the real Jesus was (and is)--especially when so many people are working to prove him to be a fake or a fraud? That&#39;s what Lee Strobel wanted to know.As a former journalist--and a former atheist--Lee went on an investigative journey to discover the real Jesus, one that took him across the continent andinto the homes of today&#39;s most prominent experts on Christian history. He found all the evidence he needed to believe that the Jesus is indeed the Risen Savior.Join Lee&#39;s investigation and discover the truth about Jesus for yourself. After you&#39;ve seen all the evidence, you&#39;ll know for certain who the real Jesus is, and you&#39;ll be able to help others know him as well.<p>Lee Strobel was the award-winning legal editor of The Chicago Tribune and is the bestselling author of The Case for Christ, The Case for Christ&nbsp;&nbsp; Devotional, The Case for Christianity Answer book, The Case for Faith, The Case for a Creator, and The Case for Grace.

Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>In <i>Einstein, History, and Other Passions</i>, Gerald Holton, a professor of physics and the history of science at Harvard University, dispels the idea that science is creatively inferior to the arts. By focusing on the life and work of Albert Einstein, Holton illustrates that the practical nature of science flows from the creative pursuit of knowledge for knowledge's sake. Holton reminds us that some of Einstein's greatest work was conducted at a time when he was madly in love and argues that scientists, like artists, are driven by a passion to explore and create. They do science, he says, not for prestige, but simply because they find it impossible not to.Gerald Holton uses the life and work of our century&#39;s greatest scientist to warn against today&#39;s gathering Romantic rebellion, one in which science is blamed for all our social ills, and in which reason is being replaced by New Age &#39;ways of knowing.&#39; Through his rich exploration of Einstein&#39;s thought, the author shows how the best science depends on great intuitive leaps of imagination, and how science is indeed the creative expression of the traditions of Western civilization. Wide-ranging and forceful, this book is a must reading for anyone interested in the place of science in our world.</p><h2>Going Against the Grain: How Reducing and Avoiding Grains Can Revitalize Your Health</h2><p><p>Diets high in grains can lead to a host of health problems such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, fatigue, and more. <i>Going Against the Grain</i> outlines the disadvantages and potential dangers of eating various types of grains and provides practical, realistic advice on implementing a plan to cut back or eliminate grains on a daily basis.

In this in-depth exploration of the relationship between Puritans in England and New England, Francis J. Bremer challenges the view that the colonists turned away from English Puritans in the 1640s. Rather, he convincingly demonstrates that the two communities retained a complex, symbiotic connection - a communion - throughout the seventeenth century, and that the clergy on both sides of the Atlantic saw themselves as closely linked in their spiritual mission. Focusing on the interaction between social experience and the shaping of belief, Bremer thoroughly analyzes how Puritan clergymen of a congregational persuasion came together in a godly communion and examines how that communion sustained them in times of trouble and physical dispersal. He explains the social forces that led to the articulation of early Congregationalism and details the significance of trans-Atlantic religious exchanges through correspondence, associations, publications, and other devices. Bremer traces the first-generation Puritans from their formative years at Cambridge University through the creation of a network of clerical friendships, through the flight to Holland and to New England, to the death of Oliver Cromwell and the beginnings of division within Congregationalism. This thought-provoking volume makes a solid contribution to Puritan studies and offers a basis for further discussions of the trans-Atlantic aspects of the Congregational community.Francis J.

Nonetheless, children still bring to literacy a wide range of experiences and competencies. How, then, might teachers best support a literate community yet still meet the needs of individual readers? For Fountas and Pinnell, the answer lies in guided reading, which allows children to develop as individual readers within the context of a small group. Their new book is the richest, most comprehensive guided reading resource available today and the first systematic offering of instructional support for guided reading adherents. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Guided Reading</i> was written for K-3 classroom teachers, reading resource teachers, teacher educators, preservice teachers, researchers, administrators, and staff developers. Based on the authors' nine years of research and development, it explains how to create a balanced literacy program based on guided reading and supported by read aloud, shared reading, interactive writing, and other approaches. While there is an entire chapter devoted solely to the process by which children become literate, every chapter clearly presents the theoretical underpinnings of the practices it suggests. Also included are guidelines for: </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>observation and assessment </li><li>dynamic grouping of readers </li><li>creating sets of leveled books </li><li>selecting and introducing books </li><li>teaching for strategies </li><li>classroom management. </li> </ul> <p>Best of all, there are well over 2,500 leveled books in the Appendixes, along with many other reproducible resources that teachers will use for years to come.

From ancient Greece to the present day its influence on later literature has been unsurpassed, and for centuries translators have approached the meter, tone, and pace of Homer's poetry with a variety of strategies. Chapman and Pope paid keen attention to color, drama, and vivacity of style, rendering the Greek verse loosely and inventively. In the twentieth century, translators such as Lattimore kept rigorously close to the sense of each word in the original; others, including Fitzgerald and Fagles, have departed further from the language of the original, employing their own inventive modern style.</p><p>Poet and translator Edward McCrorie now opens new territory in this striking rendition, which captures the spare, powerful tone of Homer's epic while engaging contemporary readers with its brisk pace, idiomatic language, and lively characterization. McCrorie closely reproduces the Greek metrical patterns and employs a diction and syntax that reflects the plain, at times stark, quality of Homer's lines, rather than later English poetic styles. Avoiding both the stiffness of word-for-word literalism and the exaggeration and distortion of free adaptation, this translation dramatically evokes the ancient sound and sense of the poem. McCrorie's is truly an <i>Odyssey</i> for the twenty-first century.</p><p>To accompany this innovative translation, noted classical scholar Richard Martin has written an accessible and wide-ranging introduction explaining the historical and literary context of the <i>Odyssey</i>, its theological and cultural underpinnings, Homer's poetic strategies and narrative techniques, and his cast of characters.

His verse line is brisk and efficient, often captures the rhythm and the sound of the Greek, and functions well as an English equivalent of the Greek hexameter. Unlike most translators, he wishes to preserve at least some of the sound of the Greek, and his rendition of the formula <i>glauk�pis Athene</i> as <i>glow-eyed Athene</i> is inspired. He remains true to the formulae of Homeric verse, and several of his choices&#x2015;such as <i>rose-fingered daylight</i> or <i>words had a feathery swiftness</i>&#x2015;delight.

A wooden puppet without strings, Pinocchio is a tragicomic figure, a poor, illiterate, naughty peasant boy who has few choices in life but usually chooses to shirk his responsibilities and get into trouble. This sly and imaginative novel, alternately catastrophic and ridiculous, takes Pinocchio from one predicament to the next, and finally to an optimistic, if uncertain, ending. In his compelling introduction, Jack Zipes places Pinocchio within the traditions of the oral folk tale and the literary fairy tale, showing how Collodi subverts those traditions while raising questions about "how we 'civilize' children in uncivilized times."<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Trained as a medical doctor as well as a philosopher, he combined these practices to demonstrate to philosophers that there could be no epistemology without concrete study of the actual development of the sciences and to historians that there could be no worthwhile history of science without a philosophical understanding of the conceptual basis of all knowledge. A Vital Rationalist brings together for the first time a selection of Canguilhem's most important writings, including excerpts from previously unpublished manuscripts and a critical bibliography by Camille Limoges. Organized around the major themes and problems that have preoccupied Canguilhem throughout his intellectual career, the collection allows readers, whether familiar or unfamiliar with Canguilhem's work, access to a vast array of conceptual and concrete meditations on epistemology, methodology, science, and history. Canguilhem is a demanding writer, but Delaporte succeeds in marking out the main lines of his thought with unrivaled clarity; readers will come away with a heightened understanding of the complex and crucial place he holds in French intellectual history.</p></p><p>Georges Canguilhem is Professor Emeritus at the Sorbonne and former director of the Institut d'Histoire des Sciences et des Techniques de l'Universit� de Paris.

It's not always stated that blatantly but the promises of the Prosperity Gospel--or the name-it-and-claim-it gospel, the health-and-wealth gospel, the word of faith movement, or positive confession theology--are false. Yet its message permeates the preaching of well-known Christian leaders: Joyce Meyer, T. D. Jakes, Joel Osteen, Creflo Dollar, Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, and many more.<br><br>The appeal of this teaching crosses racial, gender, denominational, and international boundaries. Why are otherwise faithful Christians so easily led astray? Because the Prosperity Gospel contains a grain of biblical truth, greatly distorted.<br>For anyone who knows that Prosperity Gospel theology is wrong but has trouble articulating and refuting the finer points, this concise edition contains all the robust arguments of the hard-hitting original edition in a shorter, more accessible form.</p><p>"The prosperity gospel is a false gospel, and prosperity preachers are false prophets.&nbsp; This book is as clear as that--and persuasive--but it is even more. Jones and Woodbridge have written a simple, careful account of the new religion that is sweeping Asia, Africa, and the Americas.&nbsp; And they've provided a fair, biblical and searching critique.&nbsp; I'm sad to say that this book is desperately needed; I'm thankful that it's now available."<br>- Mark Dever, Senior Pastor, Capitol Hill Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.<br><br>"The prosperity gospel is neither prosperous nor is it the gospel as defined by Scripture. Simply put, it is a false teaching and a dangerous heresy. This book written by two dear friends and superb biblical scholars carefully and accurately investigates, critiques, and exposes the biblical and theological errors that pervade this movement. This is an important and valuable work. I pray for its wide distribution and reading."&nbsp; <br>- Daniel L. Akin, President, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, Wake Forest, NC<br><br>"This book takes a balanced approach that is both biblically rigorous and in touch with current issues. This is an invaluable resource for those wishing to deal with the prosperity gospel with accuracy and clarity. This is a very Gospel-centered book."<br>- J. D. Greear, Lead Pastor of The Summit Church, Durham, NC.<br><br>"I praise God for the release of this book. It is a reliable resource for all who want to understand the destructive nature of the prosperity gospel movement. Jones and Woodbridge carefully point out its major biblical errors and call attention to the presence of erronious concepts found in prosperity theology. By exposing these errors, as well as interacting with some of the leading proponents of the prosperity movement, Jones and Woodbridge have provided a wonderful resource to hand to those who've bought into a counterfeit gospel, and for pastors who desire to protect their flock from wolves. May God use this book to direct people to the only true Gospel, and to the Savior, who is Himself our inheritance and our treasure."<br>- Tony Merida, Teaching Pastor at Temple Baptist Church, Hattiesburg, MS<br>"In this book Jones and Woodbridge have given us the truth about the prosperity gospel. This brief survey is remarkably clear and concise, providing both the historical background and biblical critique of this movement. Their treatment is fair and balanced, penetrating to the heart, and it reveals the danger of the prosperity gospel. I highly recommend this well written book."<br>- Benjamin L. Merkle, Associate Professor of New Testament at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, Wake Forest, NC<br>"This book is long overdue.&nbsp;The authors rightly warn us that the prosperity gospel has eclipsed the true message of the cross in many pulpits.&nbsp;Sadly, much of evangelicalism has been duped by a message that sounds biblical, but on closer examination is seen to be heretical.&nbsp;I pray that this book will help correct this error."<br>- Erwin W. Lutzer, Senior Pastor, The Moody Church, Chicago, IL<br>"In a work that is long overdue, Drs. Jones and Woodbridge deal the prosperity gospel a fatal blow through their thorough research and irrefutable documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The authors, blending biblical theology with persuasive wit, create a rare blend that will appeal to both the layperson and theologian. Churches wrestling with the destructive doctrine of the prosperity gospel now have a staunch advocate and ready defense that clearly delineates God's will on such matters."&nbsp;- Emir Caner, best-selling author, President, Truett-McConnell College, Cleveland, GA<b>46% of self-identifying Christians believe God will make them rich if they have enough faith.</b><br><br>Every day on radio or TV there's a new gospel being proclaimed--the gospel of prosperity. This gospel teaches that God wants to fulfill our every desire for health, wealth, and happiness, and all it takes is enough faith. The preachers of prosperity tout their own opulent lifestyles as proof of their message: God wants his children to have it all. Is this the gospel? Or is it just a feel-good, self-centered appeal to our materialistic impulses that omits the message of Jesus and the cross?<br><br>The Bible does have a lot to say about wealth and possessions, but those teachings are routinely twisted out of context or carelessly misinterpreted. Authors David W. Jones and Russell S. Woodbridge go back to the Scriptures to set forth a truly biblical understanding of wealth, poverty, suffering, and giving. They identify five crucial areas of error related to the prosperity gospel movement and challenge readers to rediscover the true gospel of Jesus.</p><h2>Criminal Law (Black Letter Outline)</h2><p>Written by a recognizable and well respected authority in the criminal law field, this Black Letter follows in the tradition of Professor Dressler&#x2019;s casebook and treatise, in terms of coverage, organization, and easy-to-read style. Black Letter Outline on Criminal Law mirrors the coverage of the most commonly used casebooks, and even more clearly mirrors the coverage of most professors in their classrooms. Most of the Black letter focuses on the so-called "general part of the criminal law" : the basic elements of a crime, defenses to crimes, inchoate liability, and complicity&#x2014;what most professors want their students to learn. The Black Letter also thoroughly explains Criminal Homicide offenses, Rape (Sexual Assault), and the Theft crimes. Clearly and separately covering both common law and Model Penal Code principles, this Black Letter also offers user-friendly features&#x2014;such as the &#x201c;Conversation with students&#x201d; section at the beginning of each part.</p><p>McGeorge School of Law</p><h2>Fractal Market Analysis: Applying Chaos Theory to Investment and Economics</h2><p>A leading pioneer in the field offers practical applications of this innovative science. Peters describes complex concepts in an easy-to-follow manner for the non-mathematician. He uses fractals, rescaled range analysis and nonlinear dynamical models to explain behavior and understand price movements. These are specific tools employed by chaos scientists to map and measure physical and now, economic phenomena.</p><p>Business Week hailed it as the &#34;bible of market chaologists&#34;. Financial Analysts Journal ranked it &#34;among the most provocative financial books of the past few years&#34;. With the publication of Chaos and Order in the Capital Markets, Edgar E. Peters won universal acclaim for describing chaos theory for the stock, bond, and commodities markets of the 1990s. Now the most respected author on the subject of chaos theory gives traders and investors everywhere what they&#39;ve been eagerly awaiting - the first applications-oriented book on using chaos as a sophisticated market analysis tool. In Fractal Market Analysis, Edgar Peters tackles head-on tradition bound capital market theories and asset pricing models that depend on symmetry and smoothness, base their results on regular, periodic market and economic cycles, and seek to explain away as &#34;anomalies&#34; such recurring events as market stampedes and crashes. In its place, the author proposes a new &#34;fractal market hypothesis&#34;, which opens a window into the way the financial world actually is, rather than the way we would like it to be. Based on current chaos theory and using fractals - objects whose disparate parts are self-similar and which thrive on market roughness and asymmetry - the book provides a valuable new framework for accurately understanding and precisely modeling the turbulence, discontinuity, and nonperiodicity that truly characterize today&#39;s capital markets. Fractal Market Analysis delivers a robust tool for understanding the conflicting market randomness and determinism we experience every trading and investing day. Called &#34;rescaled range (R/S) analysis&#34;, it actually thrives on noise, measurement, and volatility, and is free of themathematical limitations of traditional Gaussian statistics. By following the guide&#39;s numerous step-by-step case studies, you&#39;ll learn how to apply R/S analysis to your own area of interest - bonds, equities, interest rates, foreign currencies, and gold - to more accurately determine the number and length of both nonperiodic and periodic market and economic cycles to enhance your portfolio selection. Here, finally, is the first professional guide to reconcile the rational, but limited approach of traditional quantitative management with the practical experience of actually dealing with the markets. By merging chaos theory, fractal statistics, and nonlinear dynamic modeling. Fractal Market Analysis leads you to ever-finer levels of market resolution. With it, you&#39;ll better understand short- and long-term developments, undertake more precise time series and cycle modeling, and use your conclusions to create realistic market models.<p><strong>EDGAR E. PETERS</strong> is an expert on chaos theory and its financial applications. He is Chief Investment Strategist and Director of Systematic Asset Allocation for PanAgora Asset Management, Inc., a global investment management firm. He is a frequent lecturer on market theory, and has taught investment and portfolio management at Babson College, Boston College, and Bentley College. In addition to the first edition of Chaos and Order in the Capital Markets, he is the author of Fractal Market Analysis and numerous articles in professional journals.</p></p><h2>Rainbow Valley (Anne of Green Gables)</h2><p>Anne and Gilbert have now been married for fifteen years and are busily raising their six rambunctious children in the village of Glen St. Mary. But when a new minister, John Meredith, comes to town with his own four youngsters in tow, things get very boisterous indeed. Together, the Blythe and Meredith children hatch schemes in their own private hideout--a hollow they call Rainbow Valley. There, they plot to rescue a young runaway named Mary Vance, and even form the Good-Conduct Club so the Meredith children can redeem themselves in the eyes of the disapproving townspeople.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But their grandest and most important scheme centers around poor widowed John Meredith himself, who has surprised everyone by falling in love once more. Will the Meredith children--with the help of their new friends, the Blythes--be able to bring happiness back into the life of their lonely father at last?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's always an adventure brewing in the world of Rainbow Valley.</p><p>Anne Shirley is grown up, has married her beloved Gilbert and now is the mother of six mischievous children.<p> These boys and girls discover a special place all their own, but they never dream of what will happen when the strangest family moves into an old nearby mansion. The Meredith clan is two boys and two girls, with minister father but no mother -- and a runaway girl named Mary Vance. Soon the Meredith kids join Anne's children in their private hideout to carry out their plans to save Mary from the orphanage, to help the lonely minister find happiness, and to keep a pet rooster from the soup pot.

These 32 tales cover the wide variety of Norse lore and are the result of impeccable research. Here he has repackaged 22 of them into a collection intended for juvenile audiences. Most of the tales have been reprinted verbatim from the original, and they will be inaccessible to all but the most sophisticated and motivated YA readers. Small woodcuts complement the roughness of the myths, yet they seem fragmented overall. Save your money and send those YA patrons with a pronounced interest in Norse mythology to the adult department for The Norse Myths . Denise A.

In November 1936, every state except Maine and Vermont voted enthusiastically for his reelection. But then the political winds shifted. Not only did the Supreme Court block some of his transformational experiments, but he also faced serious opposition within his own party. Conservative Democrats such as Senators Walter George of Georgia and Millard Tydings of Maryland allied themselves with Republicans to vote down New Deal bills. </p><p> </p><p> <b>Susan Dunn</b> tells the dramatic story of FDR&#x2019;s unprecedented battle to drive his foes out of his party by intervening in Democratic primaries and backing liberal challengers to conservative incumbents. Reporters branded his tactic a &#x201c;purge&#x201d;&#x2014;and the inflammatory label stuck. Roosevelt spent the summer months of 1938 campaigning across the country, defending his progressive policies and lashing out at conservatives. Despite his efforts, the Democrats took a beating in the midterm elections. </p><p> </p><p> The purge stemmed not only from FDR&#x2019;s commitment to the New Deal but also from his conviction that the nation needed two responsible political parties, one liberal, the other conservative. Although the purge failed, at great political cost to the president, it heralded the realignment of political parties that would take place in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. By the end of the century, the irreconcilable tensions within the Democratic Party had exploded, and the once solidly Democratic South was solid no more. It had taken sixty years to resolve the tangled problems to which FDR devoted one frantic, memorable summer.</p></p><p>Susan Dunn is Preston Parish &#x2019;41 Third Century Professor in the Arts and Humanities at Williams College.In 1938, when FDR tried to 'purge' conservative members of Congress who were running for reelection, he also hoped to transform the Democratic Party into a more progressive force for change. Dunn's beautifully written, deeply researched book shows how and why he failed to do so. Her history of this pivotal failure has lessons for those in our own time who might wish to do the same. (James. T. Patterson, author of <i>Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945&#x2013;1974</i>)<br><br>How the most masterful presidential politician of the last century badly miscalculated in his bid to impose discipline on his party makes for a richly detailed and riveting narrative in Dunn's superb new book. Hers is a resonant tale for today--a sharp reminder of the ideological and regional barriers confronting any president who harbors the ambition to transform American politics. (Bruce Miroff, author of <i>The Liberals' Moment: The McGovern Insurgency and the Identity Crisis of the Democratic Party</i>)<br><br>Dunn portrays one of the most dramatic episodes in the development of the American party system. FDR's assault on conservative Democrats in the midterm elections initiated changes that would eventually transform the Democratic Party--and American politics. This engagingly written book is must reading for those who wish to probe the deep roots of contemporary partisan rancor. (Sidney M. Milkis, author of <i>The President and the Parties</i>)<br><br>In the most authoritative, absorbing, and deeply researched account we now have of Roosevelt's intriguing and little-understood battle to remake the Democrats into a more consistently ideological party, Dunn shows how a master politician sought to break the deadlocks of his own time, suggesting many lessons that deserve our urgent attention today. (Michael Beschloss, author of <i>Presidential Courage and The Conquerors</i>)<br><br>Dunn delves into a fascinating and overlooked aspect of the FDR presidency: Roosevelt's brazen effort to assert control over his own party in the summer of 1938. Dunn has written an engaging story of bare-knuckled political treachery that pits a president at the peak of his popularity against entrenched congressional leaders who didn't like where he was taking the country and their party. FDR tried to use the power of the White House, and his personality, to run his opponents out of the Democratic Party. He failed miserably. (Jonathan Karl <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2010-10-13)<br><br>Dunn's examination of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's summer of '38, when he attempted to rid his party of conservative elements, couldn't be more relevant. The author colorfully and thoroughly chronicles the strategies that a once-popular president, who had helped America rise from a debilitating depression, employed when critics within his own party threatened his New Deal legislation...Roosevelt helped manipulate the outcome of Democratic primaries and supported liberals who challenged the seats of conservative incumbents...Even though FDR's efforts ultimately failed, costing him political capital and bringing a beating upon Democrats in the midterm elections, the purge was "the precursor of a historic transformation of American political parties" that "colors American Politics to this day." As the past prepares to repeat itself once more, FDR in '38 is a perfect lens through which to view our current climate. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2010-10-18)<br><br>[An] engrossing book. (Sam Rosenfeld <i>American Prospect</i> 2010-11-08)<br><br>Dunn does an excellent job of putting this purge attempt into historical as well as political context, and demonstrates that the method to FDR's madness can be seen in his effort to bring greater ideological consistency not only to the Democratic Party, but to the two-party system as well...Dunn's book is clearly argued and well written, and gives a glimpse of the inner workings of the Roosevelt White House and the Roosevelt mind. It sheds light on not only presidency studies but also the FDR era. (M. A. Genovese <i>Choice</i> 2011-05-01)</p><h2>Inside American Education</h2><p>An indictment of the American educational system criticizes the fact that the system has discarded the traditional goals of transmitting knowledge and fostering cognitive skills in favor of building self-esteem and promoting social harmony.</p><p>Our educational establishment - a vast tax-supported empire existing quasi-independently within American society - is morally and intellectually bankrupt, charges distinguished economist and social critic Thomas Sowell. And in this top-to-bottom tour of the mismanaged institutions, cynical leadership, and tendentious programs of American education, Sowell exposes the numerous &#34;deceptions and dogmas&#34; that have concealed or sought to justify the steep and very dangerous decline in our educational standards and practices across the board. Among the more serious ills of American education are the technically sophisticated brainwashing techniques now being applied to children and teenagers in so-called &#34;affective education&#34; programs; the special &#34;peace&#34; and &#34;nuclear&#34; education programs that actively promote &#34;politically correct&#34; attitudes; the &#34;values clarification&#34; and sex education curricula that portray parental and religious authority figures as agents of a repressive and unjust social and political orthodoxy; and the racial &#34;mini-establishments&#34; created on college campuses by minority demagogues and complaisant administrators that enshrine a self-serving ideological double standard, thus betraying the real interests of minority students. Sowell&#39;s exhaustively researched investigation draws particular attention to the wide array of textbooks and other instructional materials, promoted with astonishing success by a multi-million dollar industry styling itself a &#34;secular humanist&#34; movement, which fosters these ideas - ideas that are not just anti-American, Sowell maintains, but essentially totalitarian in character. These sinister curricular developments, combined with often cowardly andirresponsible management more concerned about institutional image and ranking than with fiscal integrity or a commitment to educate our youth, will breed disaster unless immediate steps are taken to reform the entire educational system.Thomas Sowell is a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University. He has been a professor of economics at leading American colleges and universities, and has lectured in Singapore, Israel, Switzerland, and Germany, as well as across the United States.</p><h2>The Code of Codes: Scientific and Social Issues in the Human Genome Project</h2><p><p> The human genome is the key to what makes us human. Composed of the many different genes found in our cells, it defines our possibilities and limitations as members of the species. The ultimate goal of the pioneering project outlined in this book is to map our genome in detail -- an achievement that will revolutionize our understanding of human development and the expression of both our normal traits and our abnormal characteristics, such as disease. <i>The Code of Codes</i> is a collective exploration of the substance and possible consequences of this project in relation to ethics, law, and society as well as to science, technology, and medicine. </p><p> The many debates on the human genome project are prompted in part by its extraordinary cost, which has raised questions about whether it represents the invasion of biology by the kind of Big Science symbolized by highenergy accelerators. While addressing these matters, this book recognizes that far more than money is at stake. Its intent is not to advance naive paeans for the project but to stimulate thought about the serious issues--scientific, social, and ethical--that it provokes. <i>The Code of Codes</i> comprises incisive essays by stellar figures in a variety of fields, including James D. Watson and Walter Gilbert and the social analysts of science Dorothy Nelkin and Evelyn Fox Keller. An authoritative review of the scientific underpinnings of the project is provided by Horace Freeland Judson, author of the bestselling Eighth Day of Creation. </p><p> The book's broad and balanced coverage and the expertise of its contributors make The Code of Codes the most comprehensive and compelling exploration available on this historymaking project. </p></p><p><b>Daniel Kevles</b> is the Stanley Woodward Professor of History and Law at Yale University.Another popularization of the Human Genome Project, this one has the distinction of being the first published as an anthology, and among its contributors are some leading scholars, scientists, and social critics. The three parts of the book present essays covering topics in "History, Politics, and Genetics," "Genetics, Technology, and Medicine," and "Ethics, Law, and Society." Some of the essays are quite provocative, especially editor Kevles's "Out of Eugenics: The Historical Politics of the Human Genome," Dorothy Nelkin's "The Social Power of Genetic Information," Ruth Schwartz Conan's "Genetic Technology and Reproductive Choice," and James D. Watson's "A Personal View of the Project." Still, there is a good deal of substantive overlap among the essays and, while the discussions by experts are more sophisticated and specialized than those appearing in other books, little new information is presented for general readers. Public libraries with either Jerry Bishop and Michael Waldholz's Genome ( LJ 7/90) or Robert Shapiro's The Human Blueprint ( LJ 9/1/91) do not need this title, but academic libraries should consider it.<br><i>- Gregg Sapp, Montana State Univ.

It spans the territory of more than 75 modern countries. Its large format (13 1/4 x 18 in. or 33.7 x 46.4 cm) has been custom-designed by the leading cartographic supplier, MapQuest.com, Inc., and is unrivaled for range, clarity, and detail. Over 70 experts, aided by an equal number of consultants, have worked from satellite-generated aeronautical charts to return the modern landscape to its ancient appearance, and to mark ancient names and features in accordance with the most up-to-date historical scholarship and archaeological discoveries. Chronologically, the Barrington Atlas spans archaic Greece to the Late Roman Empire, and no more than two standard scales (1:500,000 and 1:1,000,000) are used to represent most regions.</p><p>Since the 1870s, all attempts to map the classical world comprehensively have failed. The <i>Barrington Atlas</i> has finally achieved that elusive and challenging goal. It began in 1988 at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, under the direction of the distinguished ancient historian Richard Talbert, and has been developed with approximately $4.5 million in funding support.</p><p>The resulting <i>Barrington Atlas</i> is a reference work of permanent value. It has an exceptionally broad appeal to everyone worldwide with an interest in the ancient Greeks and Romans, the lands they penetrated, and the peoples and cultures they encountered in Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia. Scholars and libraries should find it essential. It is also for students, travelers, lovers of fine cartography, and anyone eager to retrace Alexander's eastward marches, cross the Alps with Hannibal, traverse the Eastern Mediterranean with St. Paul, or ponder the roads, aqueducts, and defense works of the Roman Empire. For the new millennium the <i>Barrington Atlas</i> brings the ancient past back to life in an unforgettably vivid and inspiring way.</p><p><b>Map-by-Map Directory</b></p><p>A Map-by-Map Directory to the Barrington Atlas is available online (http://assets.press.princeton.edu/B_ATLAS/B_ATLAS.PDF) and in a separate two-volume print edition of close to 1,500 pages.

All of the stories, which were written within the last twenty-five years, are set in contemporary Poland, and are by authors generally considered to be among the most significant and interesting in post-World War II Poland. Each selection is preceded by an English-language biography and literary appreciation of the author. Problems that might be encountered by the reader &#x2013; whether of a linguistic or cultural nature &#x2013; are explained in footnotes, and a glossary at the end of the book contains all of the words occurring in the stories. There is no other reader dealing exclusively with twentieth-century Polish prose.Mr. Schenker is chairman of the Department of Slavic Languages and Literature at Yale University.<br></p><p></p><h2>Capirotada: A Nogales Memoir</h2><p><p>Capirotada, Mexican bread pudding, is a mysterious mixture of prunes, peanuts, white bread, raisins, milk, quesadilla cheese, butter, cinnamon and cloves, Old World sugar--"all this," writes Alberto Rios, "and things people will not tell you."</p><p>Like its Mexican namesake, this memoir is a rich melange, stirring together Rios's memories of family, neighbors, friends, and secrets from his youth in the two Nogaleses--in Arizona and through the open gate into Mexico.</p><p>The vignettes in this memoir are not loud or fast. Yet like all of Rios's writing they are singular. Here is the story about a rickety magician, his chicken, and a group of little boys, but who plays a trick on whom? The story about the flying dancers and mortality. About going to the dentist in Mexico because it is cheaper, and maybe dangerous. About a British woman who sets out on a ship for America with the faith her Mexican GI will be waiting for her in Salt Lake City. And about the grown son who looks at his father and understands how he must provide for his own boy.</p><p>This book's uncommon offering is how it stops to address the quiet, the overlooked, the every day side of growing up. <i>Capirotada</i> is not about prison, or famous heroes.

During the course of the War, however, many of these same German Catholics raised no serious objection to serving in Germany's armies or swearing allegiance to Adolph Hitler. First published in 1962, <i>German Catholics and Hitler's Wars</i> created a furor, ultimately causing a serious reevaluation of church-state relationships and, in particular, of the morality of war. This work began as an attempt to understand the demise of the German Catholic Peace League. But because of various factors, including the destruction of vital records, Gordon C. Zahn began to consider the behavior of German Catholics in general and the evidence of their almost total conformity to the war demands of the Nazi regime. Using sociological analysis, he argues convincingly for the existence of a super-effective system of social controls, and of a selection between the competing values of Catholicism and nationalism. Although Zahn never speculates, conclusions are inescapable, chief among them that the traditional Catholic doctrine of the "just war" has ceased to be operative for Catholics in the modern world.</p><p>Gordon C. Zahn (1918&#x2013;2007) was professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and former national director for the Center on Conscience and War.</p><h2>Praxis Core For Dummies, with Online Practice Tests (For Dummies Series)</h2><p><p><b>Get the ultimate guide to the Praxis� Core Academic Skills for Educators, complete with practice tests</b></p> <p>The Praxis� Core Academic Skills for Educators test has replaced the Praxis (PPST) as the pre-certification exam for educators, and plenty has changed.

For too long, architects have avoided questioning how the central aspects of architectural &#x201c;practice&#x201d; (professionalism, profit, technology, design, craft, and building) combine to characterize the work performed in the architectural office. Nor has there been a deeper evaluation of the unspoken and historically-determined myths that assign cultural, symbolic, and economic value to architectural labor.<br><i></i><br><i>The Architect as Worker</i> presents a range of essays exploring the issues central to architectural labor. These include questions about the nature of design work; immaterial and creative labor and how it gets categorized, spatialized, and monetized within architecture; the connection between parametrics and BIM and labor; theories of architectural work; architectural design as a cultural and economic condition; entrepreneurialism; and the possibility of ethical and rewarding architectural practice. </p><p>The book is a call-to-arms, and its ultimate goal is to change the practice of architecture. It will strike a chord with architects, who will recognize the struggle of their profession; with students trying to understand the connections between work, value, and creative pleasure; and with academics and cultural theorists seeking to understand what grounds the discipline.</p></p><p>With contributions from both architectural practice and theory, this anthology is the first to explore the nature of the work that professional architects perform in practice.<b>Peggy Deamer</b> is Professor of Architecture and Assistant Dean at Yale University, USA, and a visiting scholar at Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand.</p><h2>Good-Bye to All That</h2><p>Thus begins Robert Graves&#39; classic 1929 autobiography with its searing account of life in the trenches of the First World War; and yet this opening passage, together with much significant material, has been unavailable since 1957, when a middle-aged Graves totally revised his text,robbing it of the painfully raw edge that had helped to make it an international bestseller. By 1957 major changes in his private life had taken place. Graves was no longer living with Laura Riding, under whose influence and in whose honor the original had been written. By cutting outall references to Riding, by deleting passages which revealed the mental strains under which hehad labored, and by meticulously editing the entire text, Graves destroyed most of what he hadmade so powerful but also removed from it the only context in which it could be fully understood. We are pleased to offer the original 1929 edition on the occasion of Graves 100th anniversary, edited and annotated by Robert Graves&#39;s nephew and biographer, whose lucid introduction greatly enhances its value. Richard Perceval Graves lives in Shrewsbury, Britain, and has published Robert Graves: TheAssault Heroic 1895-1926 (1986). His most recent publication is Richard Hughes (1994) another book on his uncle, Robert Graves and the White Goddess, is scheduled for 1995.</p><p>The quintessential memoir of the generation of Englishmen who suffered in World War I is among the bitterest autobiographies ever written. Robert Graves's stripped-to-the-bone prose seethes with contempt for his class, his country, his military superiors, and the civilians who mindlessly cheered the carnage from the safety of home. His portrait of the stupidity and petty cruelties endemic in England's elite schools is almost as scathing as his depiction of trench warfare. Nothing could equal Graves's bone-chilling litany of meaningless death, horrific encounters with gruesomely decaying corpses, and even more appalling confrontations with the callousness and arrogance of the military command. Yet this scarifying book is consistently enthralling. Graves is a superb storyteller, and there's clearly something liberating about burning all your bridges at 34 (his age when <i>Good-Bye to All That</i> was first published in 1929). He conveys that feeling of exhilaration to his readers in a pell-mell rush of words that remains supremely lucid. Better known as a poet, historical novelist, and critic, Graves in this one work seems more like an English Hemingway, paring his prose to the minimum and eschewing all editorializing because it would bring him down to the level of the phrase- and war-mongers he despises. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>English novelist, poet, and essayist Graves, author of <i>I, Claudius</i> describes the break he made with his past in 1929. In chronicling his youth, World War I experiences, and years at Oxford, Graves gives parallel accounts of the end of his own innocence and that of the world prior to the Great War.</p><h2>Musculoskeletal Disorders in the Workplace: Principles and Practice</h2><p>Completely revised and updated, the 2nd Edition of this respected reference covers both the theoretical background and the clinical management&#x2015;as well as the biomechanics and ergonomics&#x2015;of orthopedic injuries occurring in the workplace.<br><br>� Emphasizes the prevention of disability.<br><br>� Offers expanded coverage of specific disorders � new topics, including whiplash � and a new section on outcome evaluation.<br><br>� Includes Workplace Adaptations with Case Studies in every body segment chapter.<br><br>Features several new chapters: Functional Capacity Testing � Disability Evaluation � Treatment Options for the Wrist and Hand � Evaluation of the Neck � and Epidemiology of the Neck.</p><p>Margareta Nordin, Dr.Med.Sci., New York University Medical Center, New York, NY; Gunnar B.

Eleven years later, I walked across the graduation stage to receive a PhD in math, a strange journey indeed. After two years at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania, I came home to Ohio, accepting a tenure-track job at the Hamilton campus of Miami University. I&#x2019;ve won a number of teaching awards in my career, and while maintaining an active teaching schedule, I now spend an inordinate amount of time writing textbooks and course materials. I&#x2019;ve written or co-authored either seven or twelve textbooks, depending on how you count them, as well as several solutions manuals and interactive CD-ROMS. After many years as developmental math coordinator at Miami Hamilton, I share the frustration that goes along with low pass rates in the developmental math curriculum. Far too many students end up on the classic Jetson&#x2019;s-style treadmill, with the abstract nature of the traditional algebra curriculum keeping them from reaching their goals. Like so many instructors across the country, I believe the time is right to move beyond the one-size-fits-all curriculum that treats students the same whether they hope to be an engineer or a pastry chef. &#x201c;Because we&#x2019;ve always done it that way&#x201d; is NOT a good reason to maintain the status quo in our curriculum. Let&#x2019;s work together to devise alternate pathways that help students to learn more and learn better while hastening their trip into credit-bearing math courses. Since my book (Math in Our World) is written for the Liberal Arts Math and Quantitative Literacy market, I think I&#x2019;m in the right place at the right time to make a difference in the new and exciting pathways course. I&#x2019;m in a very happy place right now: my love of teaching meshes perfectly with my childhood dream of writing. (Don&#x2019;t tell my publisher this &#x2013; they think I spend 20 hours a day working on textbooks &#x2013; but I&#x2019;m working on my first novel in the limited spare time that I have.) I&#x2019;m also a former coordinator of Ohio Project NExT, as I believe very strongly in helping young college instructors focus on high-quality teaching as a primary career goal. I live in Fairfield, Ohio with my lovely wife Cat and fuzzy dogs Macleod and Tessa.

This collection includes poems and plays that were not included in Shakespeare's First Folio of 1623 to make one complete, authentic collection. For Shakespeare fans worldwide, this stunning gift edition has a full cloth binding, foil blocking on the spine, ribbon marker, and is packaged neatly in an elegant slipcase. <i>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare</i> contains essential reading like <i>Hamlet, Romeo &amp; Juliet, King Lear, Othello, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Macbeth, Julius Caesar </i>and<i> Henry V </i>alongside many lesser-known gems for a complete Shakespearean education.</p></p><p><p><b>William Shakespeare</b> was an English poet and playwright, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon." His extant works include some collaboration, consisting of about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, the authorship of some of which is uncertain. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.</p><p><b>John Lotherington</b> has written widely on Renaissance literature and history, including co-authored surveys of sixteenth-century Europe, <i>Years of Renewal</i>, and sixteenth-century England, <i>The Tudor Years</i>.&nbsp; He is at present a Program Director at the Salzburg Global Seminar.</p>Very considerate price.

There are specialized treatises on various aspects of the foundations of Qm, but none that integrate those topics with the standard material. This book aims to remove that unfortunate dichotomy, which has divorced the practical aspects of the subject from the interpretation and broader implications of the theory. The book is intended primarily as a graduate level textbook, but it will also be of interest to physicists and philosophers who study the foundations of Qm. Parts of it could be used by senior undergraduates too.</p><p>&#34;? the book is of greatest benefit to students of quantum mechanics who want to learn more than solely computational recipes and predictive tools of the theory, and, in this sense, the book really fills a gap in the literature.&#34; Mathematical Reviews, 1999</p><h2>Evaluating Practice: Guidelines for the Accountable Professional (5th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Evaluating Practice</i> </b> <b> continues to be the most comprehensive practice evaluation text available. </b> </p> <p>Focusing on single-system designs, <i>Evaluating Practice</i>, Fifth Edition, presents clear guidelines on conceptualizing and measuring problems, developing practice-oriented evaluation designs, understanding and analyzing data, and ethical guidelines for practice evaluation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically written for students and practitioners in all the human services, including social work, psychology, counseling, nursing and psychiatry.&nbsp; Unsurpassed among human service evaluation texts for bringing clarity to evaluation procedures, <i>Evaluating Practice </i>comes with a free CD-ROM featuring numerous programs, &nbsp;including the innovative SINGWIN program for analyzing data (created by Charles Auerbach, David Schnall, and Heidi Heft Laporte of Yeshiva University), and the CASS and CAAP programs (created by Walter Hudson) for managing cases and scoring scales. </p> <p>The improved and expanded CD-ROM contains an &#x201c;Intervention Plan&#x201d; form that can be used to develop a comprehensive intervention and evaluation plan of action that parallels chapters in the text.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CD-ROM also contains a new &#x201c;running case&#x201d; that can be used interactively to try out concepts and procedures from the text.&nbsp; Significant updates to SINGWIN (on CD-Rom), including the incorporation of new statistical procedures designed for ease of application.&nbsp; And the prologue offers an extensive case illustrating the integration of practice, ethics, and evaluation for students, making the text even more appealing to practitioners.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></p><p><i>Evaluating Practice</i> continues to be the most comprehensive practice evaluation text available.

The recent development of complex systems dynamics may afford Darwinism yet another occasion to expand its explanatory power.</p><p>Darwinism's use of dynamical models has received insufficient attention from biologists, historians, and philosophers who have concentrated instead on how evolutionary biology has maintained its autonomy from physics. Yet, as Depew and Weber observe, it is only by recovering Darwin's own relationship to Newtonian models of systems dynamics, and genetical Darwinism's relationship to statistical mechanics and probability theory, that insight can be gained into how Darwinism can successfully meet the challenges it is currently facing.</p><p>Drawing on recent scholarship in the history of biology, Depew and Weber bring the dynamical perspective to bear on a number of important episodes in the history of the Darwinian research tradition: Darwin's "Newtonian" Darwinism, the rise of "developmentalist" evolutionary theories and the eclipse of Darwinism at the turn of the century, Darwinism's struggles to incorporate genetics, its eventual regeneration in the modern evolutionary synthesis, challenges to that synthesis that have been posed in recent decades by molecular genetics, and recent proposals for meeting those challenges.</p><p><i>A Bradford Book</i></p></p><p>David J.

A Jew passing as a Christian in occupied Poland, Rufeisen worked as translator for the German police--the very people who rounded up and murdered the Jews--and repeatedly risked his life to save hundreds from the Nazis. In this gripping biography, Nechama Tec, a widely acclaimed writer on the Holocaust, recounts Rufeisen's remarkable story.<br> A youth of seventeen when World War II began, Rufeisen joined the exodus of Poles who fled the approaching German army. Tec vividly describes how Rufeisen used his ability to speak fluent German to pass as half German and half Polish in Mir, where he came to serve as translator and personal secretary to the German in charge of the gendarmerie. As he carried out his duties--reading death sentences to prisoners, swearing in new police officers before a portrait of Hitler--he earned the trust and affection of the German commander, yet lived in constant fear of discovery. He used his position to pass secret information to Jews and Christians about impending "aktions" and to sabatoge Nazi plans. Most notably, he thwarted the annihilation of the Mir ghetto by arming hundreds of doomed Jews and organizing their escape, and saved an entire Belorussian village from destruction. Denounced, Rufeisen escaped and found shelter in a convent, where he converted to Catholicism. Though a pacifist, he spent the rest of the war fighting in a Russian partisan unit.<br> After the war, Father Daniel (as he is now known) became a priest and a Carmelite monk. Identifying himself as a Christian Jew and an ardent Zionist, he moved to Israel, where he challenged the Law of Return in a case that reached the High Court and attracted international attention. Today he continues to devote himself to bridging the gap between Christians and Jews.<br> <em>In the Lion's Den</em> offers a stirring portrait of a Jewish rescuer during the Holocaust and its aftermath, illuminating the intricate connections between good and evil, cruelty and compassion, and Judaism and Christianity.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nechama Tec</strong> is Professor of Sociology at the University of Connecticut, Stamford. She is the author of <em>When Light Pierced the Darkness</em>, <em>Dry Tears</em>, and other writings which explore the rare aspects of human experience during the Holocaust.<br>Based upon interviews and documents, Tec recounts an unusual tale of heroism and survival during World War II and pursues themes of earlier works ( Dry Tears: The Story of a Lost Childhood; When Light Pierced the Darkness, LJ 1/86). Rufiesen, a Polish Jew, posed as a Christian and became a gendarme and translator for the Germans in order to escape the Holocaust. Through his position he saved many Jews and partisans from death. When forced to flee and take refuge in a convent, he became a Catholic and later a priest and monk. Following the war he served his church in Israel, where he sued unsuccessfully for recognition as a Jew by nationality, not religion. Tec makes Rufiesen's life into a testament that the individual may not only endure but prove his moral strength when confronted with evil.

The author provides useful vignettes, case studies, and personal insights to help both beginning and experienced therapists develop more empathy in therapeutic relationships. He asserts that the first step toward effective treatment is empathic self-transformation in the therapist. It is empathy and self-transformation that lie at the heart of being helpful. Topics include vulnerability, nurturing, helplessness, forgiveness, and spirituality, as well as tips for working with clients in extreme emotional crises, children and families, and patients of culturally diverse backgrounds.</p></p><p>"After years of detailing the myths and abuses of biopsychiatry, Peter Breggin comes full circle.

In 1985 the group announced preparation of an anthology of Irish writers over the past 500 years that would for the first time posit a plural rather than partisan view of issues that have wracked Belfast in particular for 20 years. Today Field Day, especially for its pamphlets and theater presentations, is a European model for engaged intelligentsia; the anthology appears as a three-volume, 4000-page accretion of writing on Ireland over 1500 years. Both Field Day and its anthology are very heady projects; both succeed beyond all expectation. The emphasis here is on writing of many kinds about Ireland. And not only James Joyce and W.B. Yeats but also Cromwell and Charles II are among the authors included. And not only the usual songs and ballads but also historical and philosophical works are among the texts that appear. Editorial organization is by kind of writing. While important writers get their blocks of space, they are also likely to make cameo appearances in sections devoted to, for example, "Drama 1690-1800," "Political Writings and Speeches on Home Rule 1850-1917," or "Northern Protestant Oratory and Writings of 1791-1985." This is an element of some novelty for Norton anthologies. It derives from both contemporary critical theory and also from the impact of literary ideologies especially apparent in Ireland. The result is both state-of-the-art literary history and a genuinely fascinating reference work complete with quality introductions, headnotes, annotations, bibliographies, and index. Qualitatively and quantitatively, this is without question the mother of all Irish anthologies. --John P. Harrington, Cooper Union, New York<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Field Day is an affiliation of writers and poets from the North and South of Ireland, founded by the playwright Brian Friel and actor Stephen Rea. Its purpose is to present a version of Ireland's history, past and present. Under the editorship of scholar and poet Seamus Deane, 1500 years of writing by the Irish and the Anglo-Irish, in English, Latin, French and Gaelic, is here assembled. In making the selections, says Deane in his introduction, "we avoid the narrow sense of the word 'literature,' extending it to cover various other kinds of writing"--speeches and songs as well as poems, short stories, drama and excerpts from novels. Volume III is a treasure trove of modern Irish literature--everyone is here, including a few now rehabilitated as Irish poets, such as Louis MacNeice; the essays that accompany each section, even the ones on those objects of literary industry, Joyce and Beckett, manage to situate various literary accomplishments against the sweep of Irish, British and European history. Perhaps the anthology's most important achievement, when all three volumes are taken as a whole, is what Deane refers to as the "meta-narrative," in which a culture struggles against and within a colonizing presence (and language) to discover its own voice while extending the canon of the dominant literature. How this struggle was waged--in letters, in the streets, in the reaches of song--is the long, stirring testimony of this invaluable collection. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wilhelm Meister&#39;s Apprenticeship (Goethe: The Collected Works, Vol. 9)</h2><p><p><i>Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship</i>, a novel of self-realization greatly admired by the Romantics, has been called the first <i>Bildungsroman</i> and has had a tremendous influence on the history of the German novel.

Whether they are multinational corporations, small businesses, schools, hospitals, voluntary agencies, governments, or religious institutions, they must learn how to change rapidly in order to survive in a turbulent environment. And as organizations shift from a traditional hierarchical structure to a more flexible and participative networking style, leaders need a decision-making process that will foster the involvement and commitment of all of their people - and align them to common goals. Large group interventions can provide this process, bringing as many as 2,000 employees and customers together in one location for activities as diverse as creating future direction, restructuring the organization, solving problems, and generating new ideas and products. Large Group Interventions is the first book to present and compare different large group intervention methods and describe the situations and conditions under which each might be used. Barbara Benedict Bunker and Billie T. Alban present a comprehensive overview of the twelve methods of large group interventions currently in practice. The authors describe the methods&#39; origins, explore their differences and similarities, and present vivid examples and case studies that give the reader a firsthand account of each intervention.<p><b>Barbara Benedict Bunker</b> is emeritus professor of psychology at the State University of New York at Buffalo.

With far-reaching applications in almost every field, regression analysis is used in engineering, the physical and chemical sciences, economics, management, life and biological sciences, and the social sciences.<br> Clearly balancing theory with applications, Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis describes conventional uses of the technique, as well as less common ones, placing linear regression in the practical context of today's mathematical and scientific research. Beginning with a general introduction to regression modeling, including typical applications, the book then outlines a host of technical tools that form the linear regression analytical arsenal, including: basic inference procedures and introductory aspects of model adequacy checking; how transformations and weighted least squares can be used to resolve problems of model inadequacy; how to deal with influential observations; and polynomial regression models and their variations. Succeeding chapters include detailed coverage of:<br> * Indicator variables, making the connection between regression and analysis-of-variance modelss<br> * Variable selection and model-building techniques<br> * The multicollinearity problem, including its sources, harmful effects, diagnostics, and remedial measures<br> * Robust regression techniques, including M-estimators, Least Median of Squares, and S-estimation<br> * Generalized linear models<br> The book also includes material on regression models with autocorrelated errors, bootstrapping regression estimates, classification and regression trees, and regression model validation. Topics not usually found in a linear regression textbook, such as nonlinear regression and generalized linear models, yet critical to engineering students and professionals, have also been included. The new critical role of the computer in regression analysis is reflected in the book's expanded discussion of regression diagnostics, where major analytical procedures now available in contemporary software packages, such as SAS, Minitab, and S-Plus, are detailed. The Appendix now includes ample background material on the theory of linear models underlying regression analysis.

In 1976 Bellow was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature "for the human understanding and subtle analysis of contemporary culture that are combined in his work."Bellow&#39;s best-seller is the story of the relationship between Charles Citrine, a best-selling author, and his friend Von Humboldt Fleisher, a failed poet. It is not one of Bellow&#39;s greatest efforts, but was well-received when published almost twenty years ago. This production is exceedingly well-narrated by Christopher Hurt, whose narrator&#39;s voice conveys the various moods of the main character, Charles Citrine, an aging Lothario, battling the aging process and his writer&#39;s block. Some production flaws mar the presentation but can&#39;t overshadow the fine quality of the narrator&#39;s interpretation. E.F.

The result is a volume of essays that makes a strong case for recuperating provenance&#x2014;what contributing author Anne Higonnet calls &#x201c;so many epic tales compressed into such dry lists&#x201d;&#x2014;for the history of art. Provenance attends to the social life of art, a work's biography subsequent to the moment of its origin.&nbsp;<br><i>Provenance: An Alternate History of Art</i> offers a broad perspective that ranges from ancient archaeology to conceptual art, that encompasses Europe, Asia, and the Americas, and considers a variety of media. The essays demonstrate in myriad ways how an owner&#x2019;s relationship with a work of art or, in varying degrees, with the object&#x2019;s previous owners, can change irrevocably the way the work will be perceived and understood by future generations.&nbsp;<br>Limiting the scope of provenance to only the highly charged context of international legal custody battles or the painstakingly researched lists of names and dates in archives and catalogs is entirely insufficient to the richness of the subject.

This venerable ethics code was challenged in the years after World War II by the remarkable advances in the biomedical sciences and medicine that raised questions about the definition of death, the use of life-support systems, organ transplantation, and reproductive interventions. In response, philosophers and theologians, lawyers and social scientists joined together with physicians and scientists to rethink and revise the old standards. Governments established commissions to recommend policies. Courts heard arguments and legislatures passed laws.<br> This book is the first broad history of the growing field of bioethics. Covering the period 1947-1987, it examines the origin and evolution of the debates over human experimentation, genetic engineering, organ transplantation, termination of life-sustaining treatment, and new reproductive technologies. It assesses the contributions of philosophy, theology, law and the social sciences to the expanding discourse of bioethics. Written by one of the field's founders, <em>The Birth of Bioethics</em> is based on extensive archival research into sources that are difficult to obtain and on interviews with many of the leading figures in the moral debates in medicine. A very readable and comprehensive account of the evolution of bioethics, this book stresses the history of ideas but does not neglect the social and cultural context and the people involved. It will serve the information needs of philosophers, ethicists, social historians, and everyone interested in the origins of some of today's most hotly debated issues.</p><p><br><strong>Albert R. Jonsen</strong>, Ph.D., is Chairman of the Department of Medical History and Ethics and Professor of Ethics in Medicine at the School of Medicine, University of Washington. He is a member of the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences, and has served on the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research and the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine.<br>The field of bioethics has grown enormously over the past few decades. Consequently, people entering the field may try to acquire knowledge about it as rapidly as possible by learning only about current consensus and controversies. By doing so, however, they may not learn that accepted or controversial views concerning bioethics can reflect the time and circumstances in which they arose. Without this awareness, they may not realize that some of those who helped forge bioethics did so at considerable personal sacrifice. And without this awareness, they may not anticipate what they, too, must do if they believe that their views should be heard and should prevail.<p> In The Birth of Bioethics Jonsen has written an in-depth review of bioethics, including a historical analysis of the field. But this is also a book about heroes. </p><p> Jonsen presents the growth of bioethics from 1947, when the Nuremberg Code was drawn up, to 1987. He does so in three chapters on the religious, philosophical, and governmental aspects of the subject. He covers five major areas of bioethics, including research and death and dying, and deals with bioethics as a discipline and as a topic of discourse. In the final chapter, he gives his explanation of why bioethics arose in this country. </p><p> The history he presents includes advanced ideas, such as H. Tristram Engelhardt's concept of ethics as an "enterprise in controversy resolution" and Robert Veatch's criticism of the assumption of moral authority by persons with technical competence or what he calls the "generalization of expertise." This material should inform even sophisticated readers. Comprehensive footnotes and illuminating cross-references reflect Jonsen's consummate knowledge of theology, philosophy, history, and literature. He cites Homer and Shakespeare, and he makes the history of bioethics come alive, because he was there. </p><p> For instance, I have taught bioethics to medical students for 20 years using a well-known film about a baby born at Johns Hopkins Hospital with Down's syndrome and an intestinal blockage requiring surgery. I learned only from this book that the chairperson of the pediatrics department at Johns Hopkins had had two children with developmental disabilities and that the person who portrayed the baby's doctor in this film had actually been an intern then and had felt a sense of moral outrage at the time. </p><p> Jonsen's depictions of the pioneers in bioethics whom he knew and worked with are vivid. Joseph Fletcher, for instance, stood in picket lines, and "turned to... bioethics because everything else was so vicious." Paul Ramsey had this to say about a conference held in the Valley of the Moon in Sonoma, California, to determine whether neonates with severe defects should ever be allowed to die: "The symbolism... should not be lost: a valley on a dead satellite of our mother earth." Warren Reich and George Kanoti, while they were nontenured professors at the Catholic University of America, expressed unpopular views that resulted in their being invited to resign. But Jonsen is with them: "It began to dawn on me that as a newly minted moral theologian, I would not be comfortable or conscientious teaching the traditional doctrine on abortion and contraception." </p><p> Jonsen's own beliefs, no doubt, influence which areas he chooses to emphasize. He pays particular attention to the influence of Catholic religious doctrine and of the theologians Joseph Fletcher, Richard McCormick, and Paul Ramsey. Yet Jonsen sees no major issue in American bioethics in which religious and philosophical ethics did not collaborate and sees this "trinity" of theologians as having presided over the birth of bioethics. </p><p> Jonsen's unique insights, infused by the compassion he obviously feels, recommend this book strongly. Jonsen's own words are compelling. In regard to choosing whether to allow neonates to die, he states, "The hope seems so great and the loss so devastating to parents that the decision... is particularly agonizing." About the rise of bioethics in the United States he says, "My hypothesis is that the American ethos is strongly tempted to endow various aspects of life with moral meaning in a capricious way." And, with respect to the new forms of technology that have been developed to help women bear children he states, "The difficulty of unraveling the ethics of reproductive technology may be due to our impoverished ability to recognize and appreciate what is normal about being human." </p><p> <i>Reviewed by Edmund G.

They transformed life and captured the imagination. Yet by 1907 railroads had also become the largest cause of violent death in the country, that year claiming the lives of nearly twelve thousand passengers, workers, and others. In <i>Death Rode the Rails</i> Mark Aldrich explores the evolution of railroad safety in the United States by examining a variety of incidents: spectacular train wrecks, smaller accidents in shops and yards that devastated the lives of workers and their families, and the deaths of thousands of women and children killed while walking on or crossing the street-grade tracks. </p><p>The evolution of railroad safety, Aldrich argues, involved the interplay of market forces, science and technology, and legal and public pressures. He considers the railroad as a system in its entirety: operational realities, technical constraints, economic history, internal politics, and labor management. Aldrich shows that economics initially encouraged American carriers to build and operate cheap and dangerous lines. Only over time did the trade-off between safety and output&#x2015;shaped by labor markets and public policy&#x2015;motivate carriers to develop technological improvements that enhanced both productivity and safety.</p><p>A fascinating account of one of America's most important industries and its dangers, <i>Death Rode the Rails</i> will appeal to scholars of economics and the history of transportation, technology, labor, regulation, safety, and business, as well as to railroad enthusiasts.</p></p><p><p><b>Mark Aldrich </b>is the Marilyn Carlson Nelson Professor of Economics Emeritus at Smith College and the author of <i>Safety First: Technology, Labor, and Business in the Building of American Work Safety, 1870&#x2013;1939</i>, also published by Johns Hopkins.</p><p>"A fascinating account of one of America's most important industries and its dangers."</p> (<i>Scale Rails</i>)<br><br><p>"A well-made book such as this one stands out as a rare exception."</p> (<i>Scitech Book News</i>)<br><br><p>"Students of rail safety, and today's Class I railroad managers, need to read this volume."</p> (Ray Weart <i>Trains</i>)<br><br><p>"Aldrich has created a masterpiece.

That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned and, above all, simple novel became <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace be comes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.<p> It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties and waits for her to appear. When s he does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbour Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted and written in crystalline prose, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem. <i>Perry Freeman, Amazon.com</i></p>"Although it is hard to believe this novel could improve, it has. Considering the book's significance to American letters, the Cambridge edition of The Great Gatsby could very well be the literary publishing event of the year."

Twain would have enjoyed Reiner&#39;s work in &#34;Your Show of Shows,&#34; &#34;The 2000 Year Old Man,&#34; and &#34;The Dick Van Dyke Show,&#34; just as Reiner clearly appreciates Twain&#39;s humor.&#34; Audiofile</p><h2>Hebrewspeak: An Insider&#39;s Guide to the Way Jews Think</h2><p><i>Hebrewspeak</i> is both educational and entertaining_a revised, enhanced, and jam-packed collection of Joseph Lowin's "About Hebrew" columns, featured monthly in Hadassah magazine.

There, the army's light-infantry units train against simulated guerrillas and other Third World types of opposition felt to be the most likely post^-cold war opponents. As his comprehensive and enthralling narrative admits, he and his battalion were often embarrassed during their first session together but made improvements and returned for a second, more successful visit to the center. Describing that process, Bolger paints a warts-and-all picture of today's army, its strengths (the people in it) and its weaknesses (command staff and systems) as well as a detailed portrait, worthy of Tom Clancy in his nonfiction mode, of an airborne rifle battalion. If Bolger is as good a soldier as he is a writer, he may become the first four-star general to also win a Pulitzer Prize. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>From Design into Print: Preparing Graphics and Text for Professional Printing</h2><p>A designer in New York creates a beautiful design but when she prints it the colors become muddy.

The first is that I draw as much from them as they do from me. Their youth, enthusiasm, questions, and even the doubts a few of them hold about the relevance of law to their futures, fuel my teaching. They don't know that every time they open their minds to look at a point from a new perspective or critically question something they have taken for granted, I get a wonderful reward for the word that I do. </p> <p> The other thing I know is that both teaching and learning the legal and ethical environment are all about stories. The stories I tell provide the framework on which students will hang everything they learn about the law in my class. It is my hope that long after the facts about the specific language of the statutes and legal principles have faded, they will retain that framework. Several years from now, "unintentional torts" may draw only a glimmer of recognition with students who learn about them in my class this year. However, they will likely recall the story of the woman who sued McDonalds for serving her coffee that was too hot and caused her injuries. The story sticks and give students the hook on which to hang the concepts. </p> <p> I reminded myself of these two facts when I sat down to write <i>Introduction to Law.</i> My goal is to present law and ethics in a way that will spur students to ask questions, to go beyond rote memorization. Law is an evolving outgrowth of its environment, and that environment keeps changing. In addition to the social, ethical, and international contexts I have incorporated in <i>Introduction to Law,</i> this book also emphasizes coverage of e-commerce and the Internet as two vital catalysts to the law and a key part of its environment. </p> <p> It is my wish that my commitment to these goals shines through in this labor of love, and I hope you have as much pleasure in using it as I have had in creating it for you. </p> <p><b>A Helping Hand</b></p> <p> The editors at Pearson Prentice Hall want you to know that other materials are available to help you in your studies.

The PBS series <i>Connections</i> was over two years in the making, the research and filming taking the author to twenty-three countries. James Burke lives in London.</p>James Burke synthesizes the entire course of Western history and science into this brief audiobook about how "knowledge" is subjective to the time and place in which it is created. He takes this argument further in explaining why and how science can be subjective, despite claims to the contrary. He delivers all this in a smooth and crisp British accent that reveals his experience in broadcasting, and his career with the BBC lends his voice subtle authority. However, listeners may feel overwhelmed with his long-winded explanations, which sometimes lose touch with where they started. Burke's delivery needs something more to keep listeners engaged, such as background music or more musical interludes to facilitate transitions.

This is the original: the terror-adventure tale of <i>The Lost World</i>. Writing not long after dinosaurs first invaded the popular imagination, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle spins a yarn about an expedition of two scientists, a big-game hunter, and a journalist (the narrator) to a volcanic plateau high over the vast Amazon rain forest. The bickering of the professors (a type Doyle knew well from his medical training) serves as witty contrast to the wonders of flora and fauna they encounter, building toward a dramatic moonlit chase scene with a Tyrannosaurus Rex. And the character of Professor George E. Challenger is second only to Sherlock Holmes in the outrageous force of his personality: he's a big man with an even bigger ego, and if you can grit your teeth through his racist behavior toward Native Americans, he's a lot of fun.6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Physical Meteorology</h2><p>This book has been designed for use both as a text for students of the atmospheric sciences and as an up-to-date sourcebook for researchers in allied fields who need guidance into particular topics. As a text, the book is suitable for advanced undergraduates and first-year graduate students, and each of its ten chapters concludes with a short problem set. As a sourcebook, the largely self-contained topical chapters introduce basic concepts and provide bibliographic pathways through the current literature for professionals in such fields as remote sensing of the atmosphere by earth satellite monitoring, solar energy, and acid rain.<br> <br> Four chapters cover the atmospheric aerosol and cloud physics, and four cover the processes of radiative transfer. Extended treatment is given to these two broad groups of phenomena because they directly affect the structure and motions of the atmosphere.<br> <br> In addition, there is a chapter on optical phenomena in the atmosphere (including refraction, mirages, the rainbow, the glory, the corona, the heiligenschein) and one on atmospheric electricity (covering the electrical structure of the fair weather atmosphere, the several proposed theories of thunderstorm charging and a discussion of the lightning stroke).<br> <br> Henry Houghton, a past president of the American Meteorological Society and long-time head of the MIT meteorology department, is universally recognized as one of the leading authorities on the subject of physical meteorology.

Since that time, significant advances have been made in Greek lexicography, numerous ancient manuscripts have come to light, and important steps have been taken in recovering the pristine text of each Septuagint book. Therefore, a new translation of the Septuagint into English is not only much needed, but long overdue. <br> The goal of <em>A New English Translation of the Septuagint (NETS)</em> is to provide readers with an Old Testament freshly translated from the ancient Greek text. This volume of the Psalms of the Septuagint (the first part of the project) includes footnotes calling attention to relevant textual issues.

Novosel<br><br></b>&#x201c;Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) Novosel, 82d Medical Detachment 45th Medical Company, 68th Medical Group, distinguished himself on 2 October 1969 at Kien Tuong Province, Republic of Vietnam, while serving as commander of a medical evacuation helicopter. He unhesitatingly maneuvered his helicopter into a heavily fortified and defended enemy training area where a group of wounded Vietnamese soldiers were pinned down by a large enemy force. Flying without gunship or other cover and exposed to intense machinegun fire, CWO Novosel was able to locate and rescue a wounded soldier. Since all communications with the beleaguered troops had been lost, he repeatedly circled the battle area, flying at low level under continuous heavy fire, to attract the attention of the scattered friendly troops. This display of courage visibly raised their morale, as they recognized this as a signal to assemble for evacuation. . . . In all, fifteen extremely hazardous extractions were performed in order to remove wounded personnel. As a direct result of his selfless conduct, the lives of twenty-nine soldiers were saved. The extraordinary heroism displayed by CWO Novosel was an inspiration to his comrades in arms and reflects great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.&#x201d;</p><h2>Understanding &amp;Using English Grammar, Teacher's Guide- 3rd edition</h2><p>The teacher&#39;s Guide for the Blue Azar book</p><p></p><h2>Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel: Sybex Official Strategies &amp; Secrets</h2><p>Fallout Tactics is the follow-up to Interplay&#39;s highly successful Fallout 2.

She explores in detail the sophisticated and sometimes idiosyncratic techniques that scholars and readers developed in an era of new technology and exploding information.</p></p><p><b>Ann M.

He took great pride in his writing, and he loved literature and language-French most of all. When he arrived in Paris in 1924, Brassa� began teaching himself French by reading Proust. Captured by the sensuality and visual strategies of Proust's writing, Brassa� soon became convinced that he had discovered a kindred spirit. Brassa� wrote: "In his battle against Time, that enemy of our precarious existence, ever on the offensive though never openly so, it was in photography, also born of an age-old longing to halt the moment, to wrest it from the flux of duration in order to 'fix' it forever in a semblance of eternity, that Proust found his best ally." He quoted Proust in his own writing, and from the annotated books in his library, we know that he spent a lifetime studying and dissecting Proust's prose, often line by line.<br><br>Drawing on his own experience as a photographer and author, Brassa� discovers a neglected aspect of Proust's interests, offering us a fascinating study of the role of photography both in Proust's oeuvre and in early-twentieth-century culture. Brassa� shows us how Proust was excessively interested in possessing portraits of his acquaintances and how the process by which he remembered and wrote was quite similar to the ways in which photographs register and reveal life's images. This book-beautifully translated by Richard Howard-features previously obscure photographs from Brassa�'s High Society series and offers a rare glimpse into two of France's most fascinating artistic minds.<br></p><p>Translated by Richard Howard from <i>Marcel Proust sous l'emprise de la photographie</i>.

Although studies have been published on virtually every aspect of the Lewis and Clark journey, <i>Wilderness Journey</i> is the first comprehensive account of Clark&#x2019;s lengthy and multifaceted life.Following Lewis and Clark&#x2019;s great odyssey, Clark&#x2019;s service as a soldier, Indian diplomat, and government official placed him at center stage in the national quest to possess and occupy North America&#x2019;s vast western hinterland and prefigured U.S. policies in the region. In his personal life, Clark had to overcome challenges no less daunting than those he faced in the public arena. Foley pays careful attention to the family and business dimensions of Clark&#x2019;s private world, adding richness to this well-rounded and revealing portrait of the man and his courageous life.&nbsp;<p>Coinciding with the bicentennial in 2004 of the departure of Lewis and Clark&#x2019;s famed Corps of Discovery, <i>Wilderness Journey</i> fills a major gap in scholarship.

Chapters are devoted to prefixes, roots, and suffixes; word families; homonyms and homographs; understanding the meaning of words using context clues; how to use a dictionary and thesaurus; and how to increase one's vocabulary using techniques such as games. Interesting information on the longest words in the English language, how words change in meaning and usage over time, and many tables and lists round out this useful volume. Each chapter begins with a humorous illustration, and many additional pictures are scattered throughout. The use of a light blue for words discussed, italics, and different types of fonts add interest and visual appeal to the pages. Chapters end with "Extra" pages, highlighted in blue, that give additional details, a game, or a story to solve. (Unfortunately, the wrong "main/mane" is used in the supposedly correct homonym paragraph.) Explanations and examples are clear and often amusing. The author does not talk down to young people; nor does he go over their heads or give too much detail. This easy-to-read, enjoyable guide says a great deal about language.

Furthermore, database managers can take steps to ensure that their databases collect the best possible information. <p> This is a dense book, loaded with management jargon, statistical analysis, and complicated flow diagrams. You won't succeed in skimming casually through it, and you will probably get more out of the book if you have some experience with quantitative management techniques. </p><p> Regardless, this book makes excellent reading for those taking the holistic approach to database design, in which a good database considers where the information comes from, how it is used, and what results come from that use. English covers some methods for extracting information from various sources--through surveys and other methods--before launching into an elaborate discussion of information-quality metrics. <i>--David Wall</i></p>Methods for Reducing Costs and Increasing Profits.<br> <br> "The Information Quality Bible for the Information Age!"-Masaaki Imai, Founder, Kaizen Institute and Bud H.

Rejecting all social and artistic conventions, Dadaists went to the extremes of provocative behavior, creating &#x201c;anti-art&#x201d; pieces that ridiculed and questioned the very nature of creative endeavor. To understand their movement&#x2019;s heady mix of anarchy and nihilism&#x2014;combined with a lethal dash of humor&#x2014;it&#x2019;s essential to engage with the artists&#x2019; most important writings and manifestos. And that is is precisely where this reader comes in.&nbsp;<br><br>Bringing together key Dada texts, many of them translated into English for the first time, this volume immerses readers in some of the most famous (and infamous) periodicals of the time, from Hugo Ball&#x2019;s <i>Cabaret Voltaire</i> and Francis Picabia&#x2019;s <i>391</i> to Marcel Duchamp&#x2019;s <i>The Blind Man</i> and Kurt Schwitters&#x2019;s <i>Merz</i>. Published in Europe and the United States between 1916 and 1932, these journals constituted the movement&#x2019;s lifeblood, communicating the desires and aspirations of the artists involved. In addition to providing the first representative selection of these texts, <i>The Dada Reader</i> also includes excerpts from many lesser-known American and Eastern European journals.&nbsp;<br><br>Compiled with both students and general readers in mind, this volume is necessary reading for anyone interested in one of the most dynamic and influential movements of the twentieth century. <br><br></p><p><p><b>Dawn Ades</b> is director of the Centre for Studies of Surrealism and its Legacies and professor of art history and theory at the University of Essex.</p></p><h2>Casket Empty: God&#39;s Plan of Redemption through History: New Testament Study Guide</h2><p>This book will help you understand the redemptive story of the New Testament through six major periods: Expectations, Messiah, Pentecost, Teachings and Yet-to-come, with the first letter of each heading making up the word EMPTY.

Acknowledging that the use of monetary value as a measuring rod is of limited applicability in assessing environmental and resource questions, &#34;Ecological Economics&#34; focuses instead on the crucial role played by the flows of energy and materials in the economy. Despite the dramatic increase in attention paid to ecological economics by mainstream economists since the first energy crisis of the early 1970s the subject is by no means as new as is often supposed. On the contrary, as Dr Martinez-Alier shows, it has a long and distinguished history and an extensive literature, much of it generated by the physicists, biologists and chemists of the 19th century. His discussion of these writers brings into the open for the first time a tradition of investigation and analysis which is of great contemporary relevance.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>Fighting Power: German and U.S. Army Performance, 1939-1945</h2><p>Analyses the performance of two key parties engaged in fighting during World War II.</p><p><p>n Creveld /f Martin</p>"Martin van Crevald has produced yet another provocative book that ... is bound to stimulate discussion. ...

Today, these images of sex, many of which are grossly caricatured with outrageously proportioned genitalia, are highly sought after by collectors of art and erotica the world over. Neo Shunga, introduced here as part of the current Japanese trend of restyling traditional fashions for the 21st century, brings together in one volume some of the most fascinating images to come out of the shunga movement.

Distilling the insights acquired from a significant portion of his career as a brilliant critic and teacher, he offers readers at last the book he has been writing "all my long life," a magisterial and intimately perceptive reading of the King James Bible as a literary masterpiece.</p><p>Bloom calls it an "inexplicable wonder" that a rather undistinguished group of writers could bring forth such a magnificent work of literature, and he credits William Tyndale as their fountainhead. Reading the King James Bible alongside Tyndale's Bible, the Geneva Bible, and the original Hebrew and Greek texts, Bloom highlights how the translators and editors improved upon&#x2014;or, in some cases, diminished&#x2014;the earlier versions. He invites readers to hear the baroque inventiveness in such sublime books as the Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, and Job, and alerts us to the echoes of the King James Bible in works from the Romantic period to the present day. Throughout, Bloom makes an impassioned and convincing case for reading the King James Bible as literature, free from dogma and with an appreciation of its enduring aesthetic value.</p></p><p>From the Introduction:<br><br>The largest aesthetic paradox of the KJB is its gorgeous exfoliation of the Hebrew original. Evidently the KJB men knew just enough Hebrew to catch the words but not the original music. Their relative ignorance transmuted into splendor because they shared a sense of literary decorum that all subsequent translators seem to lack. Miles Coverdale, bare both of Hebrew and of Greek, set a pattern that Miles Smith perfected. It is another of the many paradoxes of the KJB that its elaborate prose harmonies essentially were inaugurated by Coverdale&#x2019;s intuitive journey into the poems and prophecies his master Tyndale did not live to translate. We have Tyndale&#x2019;s Jonah and a medley of prophetic passages, eleven from Isaiah, in the <i>Epistle Taken out of the Old Testament.</i> How wonderful it would be to have Job, Ecclesiastes, and Jeremiah from the hand of Tyndale, though probably that would have prevented Coverdale&#x2019;s astonishing flair for style and rhythm from manifesting itself. This flair was unsteady, yet at its best it gave us something of the sonority we associate with KJB.<br><br>Tyndale, Coverdale, and the Geneva translators (including their best Hebraist, Gilby) all possessed the gift of literary authority. Their revisionist, Miles Smith, explicitly displays his sense of style in the 1611 preface, &#x201c;The Translators to the Reader,&#x201d; and implicitly stands forth by his editorial responsibility for the ways in which the KJB men handle their inheritance from previous English Bibles. Again paradox intervenes: from Tyndale through KJB the quest is to get closer to the literal sense of the Hebrew, while the consequence is to increase a cognitive music farther and farther away in regard to the Hebrew Bible&#x2019;s relative freedom from metaphors. Since all metaphor is a kind of mistake anyway, even the plain errors of the KJB sometimes add to the resultant splendor.<b>Harold Bloom</b> is Sterling Professor of the Humanities at Yale University.

HOW TO MASTER THE ENGLISH BIBLE is for the typical layperson who wants to learn to read God&#39;s Word for themselves, and know what God is really saying to us. It teaches the reader how to read the Bible in an expository manner (explaining what the Bible means by what it says). Gray teaches that rather than analyzing a passage of Scripture (taking it apart), it should be synthesized (how a specific passage fits within the whole of a book of the Bible or the Bible as a whole). Scripture explains the meaning of passages of Scripture, as God has written His Word in toto over a period of time through human authors in time and space. If you want to really understand the message of Scripture, use this book to learn to teach yourself!</p><p>Binford &amp; Mort Publishing is proud to be publishing the reprint of Dr. Gray's 1904 <i>How to Master the English Bible</i>. Dr. Gray's guide to understanding God's Word has been recommended by many Christian preachers and teachers alike as a jewel, a timeless classic. Dr. James Gray, past president of Moody Bible Institute, urged all to get back to the Bible and provides a practical tool for mastering His Word. Dr. John MacArthur, well-known and respected author and speaker has written a foreword for this new edition which has been revised only in language to bring it up to date. 5 1/2 x 8 1/2.Excerpted from <i>How to Master the English Bible</i> <p>From the Foreword by John MacArthur; "I am grateful for this new edition of an important classic. No one was more qualified than James M. Gray to write on the subject of mastering the English Bible. He trained thousands of young men and women at Moody Bible Institute, where he was president from 1904 to 1935. This legacy included several generations of Christian lay people who had mastered the English Bible under his tutelage. He also developed a Bible curriculum that has set the standard for the study of the English Bible in the Bible College and Bible Institute movement around the world. Dr. Gray's work contributed powerfully to the shaping of mainstream evangelicalism for virtually all of the twentieth century. </p><p>History reveals that wherever Scripture is available for widespread study and reading in the common languages, the spiritual health and vigor of God's people is elevated. Clergy and scholars skilled in the original languages certainly make a vital contribution, but lay people with a thorough mastery of the English Bible are the very lifeblood of a healthy church. </p><p>Dr. Gray's book has been used by God to help untold numbers of Christians gain a better grasp of the meaning of Scripture. It has also sparked in many hearts a deeper love for the Word of God and a greater confidence in Scripture's trustworthiness. Therefore I am pleased to see this book available in this new edition. May the Lord give it a vast audience once again."</p></p><h2>Aesthetics of Disappearance</h2><p>In <i>The Aesthetics of Disappearance</i>, Paul Virilio traces out the relationship of biological optics to the technological "production of appearance." In the perceptual gaps demanding illusions of continuity, Virilio posits a hyper-opportunity for the production of art in speed. Jumping from Old Testament parable to the history of contemporary cinema, to the history of philosophy and contemporary technology, Virilio teleports among an irregular constellation of high-speed artifice where love is a motion faster than light and the paradoxes of empiricism mire science in "motion without mobility."</p><p>Paul Virilio has published twenty-five books, including <i>Pure War</i> (1988) (his first in English) and <i>The Accident of Art</i> (2005), both written with Sylvère Lotringer, as well as <i>Speed and Politics</i> and <i>Lost Dimension,</i> all published by Semiotext(e).Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Exploring the Quantum: Atoms, Cavities, and Photons (Oxford Graduate Texts)</h2><p>The counter-intuitive aspects of quantum physics have been for long illustrated by thought experiments, from Einstein's photon box to Schr�dinger's cat. These experiments have now become real, with single particles--electrons, atoms or photons--directly unveiling the weird features of the quantum. State superpositions, entanglement and complementarity define a novel quantum logic which can be harnessed for information processing, raising great hopes for applications. This book describes a class of such thought experiments made real. Juggling with atoms and photons confined in cavities, ions or cold atoms in traps, is here an incentive to shed a new light on the basic concepts of quantum physics. Measurement processes and decoherence at the quantum-classical boundary are highlighted. This volume, which combines theory and experiments, will be of interest to students in quantum physics, teachers seeking illustrations for their lectures and new problem sets, researchers in quantum optics and quantum information.<br></p><p><br>Serge Haroche<br>Professor, Coll�ge de France<br>Laboratoire Kastler-Brossel,<br>d�partment de physique de l'Ecole normale sup�rieure, <br>24 rue Lhomond, 75005 Paris<br> Professor at Coll�ge de France (Chaire de Physique Quantique) since 2001<br>Member of the French Academy of Sciences since 1993<br>Professor at Universit� Pierre et Marie Curie (1975-2000) and at Ecole Normale Sup�rieure (1984-2000).<br>Ma�tre de Conf�rence at Ecole Polytechnique (1975-1984)<br>Professor (part time) at Yale University (1984-1993)<br>Senior Member of Institut Universitaire de France (1991-2000)<br>Fellow of the Americal Physical Society (1990)<br>Prix Ricard of French Physical Society (1983)<br>Michelson Medal of Franklin Insitute (1993)<br>Quantum Electronics Prize of the European Physical Society (2002)<br> Jean-Michel Raimond<br>Professor, Universit� Pierre et Marie Curie et Institut Universitaire de France<br>Laboratoire Kastler-Brossel, <br>d�partment de physique de l'Ecole normale sup�rieure, <br>24 rue Lhomond, 75005 Paris<br> Professor at Universit� Pierre et Marie Curie since 1988<br>Junior member of Institut Universitaire de France, 1994-1999<br>Senior member of Institut Universitaire de France, Quantum Optics chair, 2001-<br>Amp�re Prize of the French Academy of Sciences with M.

When World War I breaks out and the village empties, �l�onore gets a taste of the changes that will transform her world as the twentieth-century rolls on. As the reader moves into the second part of the novel, which takes place in the 1980s, the untamed world of Puy-Larroque seems gone forever. Now, �l�onore has herself aged into the role of matriarch, and the family is running a large industrial pig farm, where thousands of pigs churn daily through cycles of birth, growth, and death. Moments of sublime beauty and powerful emotion mix with the thoughtless brutality waged against animals that makes the old horrors of death and disease seem like simpler times.<br><br>A dramatic and chilling tale of man and beast that recalls the naturalism of writers like �mile Zola, <i>Animalia</i> traverses the twentieth century as it examines man&#x2019;s quest to conquer nature, critiques the legacy of modernity and the transmission of violence from one generation to the next, and questions whether we can hold out hope for redemption in this brutal world.</p></p><p><b>Jean-Baptiste Del Amo</b> is one of France&#x2019;s most exciting and ambitious young writers.

After the family had moved to Moscow in 1827 he entered Petersburg University where he studied philosophy. When he was nineteen he published his first poems and, convinced that Europe contained the source of real knowledge, went to the University of Berlin. After two years he returned to Russia and took his degree at the University of Moscow. In 1843 he fell in love with Pauline Garcia-Viardot, a young Spanish singer, who influenced the rest of his life; he followed her on her singing tours in Europe and spent long periods in the French house of herself and her husband, both of whom accepted him as a family friend. He sent his daughter by a sempstress to be brought up among the Viardot children. After 1856 he lived mostly abroad, and he became the first Russian writer to gain a wide reputation in Europe; he was a well-known figure in Parisian literary circles, where his friends included Flaubert and the Goncourt brothers, and an honorary degree was conferred on him at Oxford. His series of six novels reflect a period of Russian life from 1830s to the 1870s: they are <b>Rudin</b> (1855), <b>A House of Gentlefolk</b> (1858), <b>On the Eve</b> (1859; a Penguin Classic), <b>Fathers and Sons</b> (1861), <b>Smoke</b> (1867) and <b>Virgin Soil</b> (1876). He also wrote plays, which include the comedy <b>A Month in the Country</b>; short stories and <b>Sketches from a Hunter&#x2019;s Album</b> (a Penguin Classic); and literary essays and memoirs. He died in Paris in 1883 after being ill for a year, and was buried in Russia.Text: Russian</p><h2>Strategic Management Concepts and Cases: A Competitive Advantage Approach</h2><p><p>A skills-oriented, practitioner perspective on strategy, thoroughly updated with current research and concepts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In today&#x2019;s economy, gaining and sustaining a competitive advantage is harder than ever. <i>Strategic Management </i>captures the complexity of the current business environment and delivers the latest skills and concepts with unrivaled clarity, helping readers develop their own cutting-edge strategy through skill-developing exercises and cases.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The fourteenth edition explores the current global recession and shows how it has affected the business environment, providing readers with up-to-date coverage in every chapter.</p></p><p><p>In this highly popular guide, pre-service and in-service teachers are expertly prepared for today&#x2019;s ever-changing literacy classroom.

But few people are aware of the bagel&#x2019;s provenance, let alone its adventuresome history. This charming book tells the remarkable story of the bagel&#x2019;s journey from the tables of seventeenth-century Poland to the freezers of middle America today, a story of often surprising connections between a cheap market-day snack and centuries of Polish, Jewish, and American history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Research in international archives and numerous personal interviews uncover the bagel&#x2019;s links with the defeat of the Turks by Polish King Jan Sobieski in 1683, the Yiddish cultural revival of the late nineteenth century, and Jewish migration across the Atlantic to America. There the story moves from the bakeries of New York&#x2019;s Lower East Side to the Bagel Bakers&#x2019; Local 388 Union of the 1960s, and the attentions of the mob. For all its modest size, the bagel has managed to bridge cultural gaps, rescue kings from obscurity, charge the emotions, and challenge received wisdom. Maria Balinska weaves together a rich, quirky, and evocative history of East European Jewry and the unassuming ring-shaped roll the world has taken to its heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Maria Balinska is editor of BBC Radio&#x2019;s World Current Affairs department, and a journalist and documentary maker specializing in Eastern Europe and the United States.

ENTERPRISE</i>&nbsp;NCC-1701 &amp; 1701-A</b> &nbsp; <br><b>OPERATIONAL HISTORY<br></b><br>Launched in the year 2245, the&nbsp;<i>U.S.S. Enterprise&nbsp;</i>was in active service for 40 years, during which time it became one of the most celebrated vessels in Starfleet history.<br>&nbsp; <br>Arguably the most celebrated and distinguished starship ever commissioned by Starfleet, the&nbsp;Constitution-class&nbsp;<i>U.S.S. Enterprise&nbsp;</i>NCC-1701 was a true icon of space exploration. Its captains and the crews they commanded became Starfleet legends, and theEnterprise&#x2019;s legacy remains a potent symbol of the ideals held by the United Federation of Planets.<br><br>Following construction and shakedown cruises, the&nbsp;U.S.S. Enterprise&nbsp;NCC-1701 was formally launched in 2245 under the command of Captain Robert April. April captained theEnterprise&nbsp;during its first five years of service, becoming one of Starfleet&#x2019;s most decorated commanding officers. Following an initial five-year mission cycle, April ceded command to Captain Christopher Pike in 2250. Pike oversaw a wide variety of missions covering diplomacy, exploration and peace-keeping. In 2254, following the deaths of several crewmembers during a mission on Rigel VII, the&nbsp;Enterprise&nbsp;diverted to Talos IV after receiving a&nbsp;distress signal from the missing survey vessel&nbsp;S.S. Columbia. This led to a first-contact encounter with the isolationist Talosian race. <br><br>Subsequent to these events, the&nbsp;<i>Enterprise&nbsp;</i>embarked on a five-year mission under Pike&#x2019;s command, during which the Federation-Klingon war of 2256-57 erupted. As this period of conflict escalated,&nbsp;Constitution-class vessels were removed from the front line to maintain ongoing mission directives, with the&nbsp;<i>Enterprise&nbsp;</i>continuing its five-year mission. Ordered to investigate anomalous signals received across the Galaxy in 2257, the&nbsp;Enterprise&nbsp;suffered catastrophic system failures en route, caused by a breakdown in core holographic comms systems. Pike transferred his command to the&nbsp;<i>U.S.S. Discovery&nbsp;</i>NCC-1031 to continue the urgent mission; Meanwhile the&nbsp;<i>Enterprise&nbsp;</i>was towed to Spacedock for full diagnostic evaluation and potential refit.<br><br>The&nbsp;<i>Enterprise&nbsp;</i>remained under Pike&#x2019;s command for a&nbsp;further eight years before his promotion to Fleet Captain and the transfer of James T. Kirk to the captain&#x2019;s chair of the&nbsp;<i>Enterprise</i>&nbsp;in 2265. This heralded the commencement of a new five-year mission that confirmed the vessel&#x2019;s legendary status.</p><h2>Attention Deficit Disorder: The Unfocused Mind in Children and Adults</h2><p>A leading expert in the assessment and treatment of Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder dispels myths and offers reassuring, practical information about treatments. Drawing on recent findings in neuroscience and a rich variety of case studies from his own clinical practive, Dr. Thomas E. Brown describes what ADD syndrome is, how it can be recognized at different ages, and how it can best be treated.<p></p>This is the first book to address the perplexing question about ADD: how can individuals, some very bright, be chronically unable to &#x201c;pay attention,&#x201d; yet be able to focus very well on specific tasks that strongly interest them? Dr. Brown disputes the &#x201c;willpower&#x201d; explanation and explains how inherited malfunctions of the brain&#x2019;s management system prevent some people from being able to deal adequately with challenging tasks of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. His book is an authoritative and practical guide for physicians and psychologists, parents and teachers, and the 7 to 9 percent of persons who suffer from ADD/ADHD.<p></p></p><p>"...a fine book, rich with clinical anecdotes that provide great insight into ADD/ADHD... and scientifically based recommendations for the management of the disorder...Well done and well worth reading." -&#x2014; Russell A.

Eliot, Ezra Pound, and William Carlos Williams reimagined themselves as racial aliens and mimicked the strategies of dialect speakers in their work. In doing so, they made possible the most radical representational strategies of modern literature, which emerged from their attack on the privilege of standard language.<br> <br> At the same time, however, another movement, identified with Harlem, was struggling to free itself from the very dialect the modernists appropriated, at least as it had been rendered by two generations of white dialect writers. For writers such as Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, and Zora Neale Hurston, this dialect became a barrier as rigid as the standard language itself.<br> <br>Thus, the two modern movements, which arrived simultaneously in 1922, were linked and divided by their different stakes in the same language. In <em>The Dialect of Modernism</em>, Michael North shows, through biographical and historical investigation, and through careful readings of major literary works, that however different they were, the two movements are inextricably connected, and thus, cannot be considered in isolation. Each was marked, for good and bad, by the other.<br></p><p>Michael North is at University of California, Los Angeles.<br>"All readers...will be hard-pressed to deny North's revisionary insight for twentieth-century literary studies: black dialect as performance is an unrecognized bridge between modernism and the Harlem Renaissance. With North's generative paradigm, we can examine the movements together in new ways."--<em>American Literature</em><p></p><br>"[A] long overdue study....This may be the most significant rereading of traditional American modernists in years."--<em>South Atlantic Review</em><p></p><br>"Michael North's new book makes an indispensable contribution to the study of transatlantic modernism....Of the many recent attempts to historicize modernism, North's stands out as what will surely become an enduring model of literary and sociological analysis."--<em>Novel</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Nals Basic Manual for the Lawyer&#39;s Assistant</h2><p>NALS Basic Manual for the Lawyer&#x2019;s Assistant, 13th provides an up-to-date resource for your staff.

Drawn to the adventure and promise of learning the science of studying mountain gorillas amid the beauty of Central Africa&#x2019;s cloud forest, Fowler soon learns the cold harsh realities of life inside Fossey&#x2019;s enclave ten thousand feet up in the Virunga Volcanoes.<br><br> Instead of the intrepid scientist he had admired in the pages of National Geographic, Fowler finds a chain-smoking, hard-drinking woman bullying her staff into submission. While pressures mount from powers beyond Karisoke in an effort to extricate Fossey from her domain of thirteen years, she brings new students in to serve her most pressing need&#x2015;to hang on to the remote research camp that has become her mountain home. Increasingly bizarre behavior has targeted Fossey for extrication by an ever-growing group of detractors&#x2015;from conservation and research organizations to the Rwandan government.<br><br> Amid the turmoil, Fowler must abandon his own research assignments to assuage the troubled Fossey as she orders him on illegal treks across the border into Zaire, over volcanoes, in search of missing gorillas, and to serve as surrogate parent to an orphaned baby ape in preparation for its traumatic re-introduction into a wild gorilla group.<br><br> This riveting story is the only first-person account from inside Dian Fossey&#x2019;s beleaguered camp. Fowler must come to grips with his own aspirations, career objectives, and disappointments as he develops the physical endurance to keep up with mountain gorillas over volcanic terrain in icy downpours above ten thousand feet, only to be affronted by the frightening charges of indignant giant silverbacks or to be treed by aggressive forest buffalos. Back in camp, he must nurture the sensitivity and patience needed for the demands of rehabilitating an orphaned baby gorilla.<br><br><em>A Forest in the Clouds</em> takes the armchair adventurer on a journey into an extraordinary world that now only exists in the memories of the very few who knew it.</p><p><strong>John Fowler</strong> holds a BS in Zoology from the University of Georgia and an MS in Technology and Science Policy from Georgia Tech. In the wake of Fossey&#x2019;s murder, Zoo Atlanta invited him to Africa to assist a television crew, WSB-Atlanta, filming a documentary about Fossey in Africa. In 2007, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International asked him to participate in their fortieth anniversary celebration by escorting a group of travelers to Rwanda to visit the mountain gorillas and the site of the original Karisoke Research Center. Fowler appeared in the pages of Fossey&#x2019;s <em>Gorillas in the Mist</em> as well as Farley Mowat&#x2019;s <em>Woman in the Mists</em>. After twenty-one years working in zoological parks, he is now a research professional in Tallahassee, Florida.&#x201c;A vivid inside view of field research on two equally famous subjects: the gorillas and the notoriously difficult Fossey.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;John Fowler is a born storyteller. Prepare to climb with him high up into the forest as you experience fear, exhaustion, rain-drenched chill, and, finally, the supreme thrill of proximity with the awe-inspiring mountain&nbsp;gorillas. It was her love for them, and her fight to save them, that finally alienated Dian Fossey from human society. Unpredictable, tormented, and embittered, she now casts a dark shadow over this remote world.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Jane Goodall</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Both a visceral ethological record and a disturbing portrait of an anguished and embittered Fossey. Fowler ultimately gives Fossey her due as the researcher who taught the world to love a kindred species, even as she became increasingly estranged from her own.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Nature</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fowler describes in detail his life and work in the beautiful Virunga Mountains and shares his experiences studying gorillas at Karisoke. Vividly descriptive of the landscape, plants, and animals Fowler encounters, this fascinating memoir will appeal to those interested in Dian Fossey, gorilla conservation, and the life of a research scientist.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Of interest to students of field science as well as devotees of <em>Gorillas in the Mist</em>.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fowler&#x2019;s memoir of his year spent as a student assistant at the Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda conveys delight in and appreciation for gorilla-human relationships.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c; <p>Finally a detailed account on Dian Fossey, the savior of the mountain gorillas who was murdered in 1985, by one of her students at the Karisoke Research Centre (and who often experienced her psychotic outbursts). There&#x2019;s plenty of lyrical natural description on the flora and fauna, as well as portraits of individual gorillas and colleagues whom he came to know well.&nbsp; It must have been hard for Fowler to relive the abuse he was subjected to by this damaged woman, but I'm glad he has left us such a full record of his time in the magical Virungas.</p> &#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alex Shoumatoff, author of The Wasting of Borneo and editor of DispatchesFromTheVanishingWorld.com</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Be prepared for tension, joy, and awe as you trek through the primitive cloud forest in Rwanda&#x2015;an unnerving chill takes hold in response to Fowler&#x2019;s vivid descriptions of the rugged and wild home of the mountain gorillas, along with the overwhelmingly cantankerous manner of their protector, Diane Fossey. You will experience stark contrasts between the relentless rain and the warmth of the engaging personality of a baby gorilla, whom the author cares for and helps reunite with her own kind. The result is a deeply insightful portrait of a famous heroine whose bizarre nature teaches us as much about primates as &#x2018;her' gorillas teach us.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Crocker, author of Following Fifi: My Adventures Among Wild Chimpanzees</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>A Forest in the Clouds</em>&nbsp;is a vivid and heartbreaking portrait of the last years of one of the most compelling figures in wildlife conservation history. My heart goes out to the author, one of Dian Fossey's students, who&nbsp;faced her rages, her tirades, and flashes of her compassion and insight. But my sympathy goes to Dian as well, and to all the sometimes-warring factions of quirky researchers, students, former students,&nbsp;brave Rwandan staff, and local expats you will meet in this book. But most of all, I loved reading about the gorillas, especially the baby the author cared for and returned to the wild. Reading this book gives me new&nbsp;appreciation for the miracle of the mountain gorillas.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sy Montgomery, author of Walking with the Great Apes</strong><br><br>&#x201c;John Fowler cut his teeth in the animal world working as a researcher for Dian Fossey on her renowned Karisoke Research Center in Africa. High up in the mountains of Rwanda, he introduces us to the gorillas and the&nbsp;people studying their everyday habits as they trek through an impossibly thick, wild habitat. Fowler's refreshing honesty and affection for the gorillas runs through every page of this book. The gorillas become fascinating&nbsp;characters, along with Fossey, who is often more dangerous than the subjects of her study.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Elizabeth Hess, author of Nim Chimpsky: The Chimp who Would be Human</strong></p><h2>Relativity of Wrong: Essays on Science</h2><p>In this collection of seventeen essays, the author ruminates on the moon&#39;s effect on human behavior, the makeup of the Milky Way, interstellar travel, and right and wrong absolutes in scientific theory</p><p>This volume from the vastly prolific Asimov is a collection of his nonfiction monthly essays in the 1986-87 issues of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction , for which he has been writing since 1958. Except for the title piece, which deals with the degree of correctness of modern science in general, all the chapters are on chemical or astronomical subjects such as carbon-14 or the size of Pluto. Several selections have been updated where very recent scientific developments have made it necessary.

These men led the Jacobin Club between 1789 and 1794, and were attempting to establish new democratic politics in France. Exploring revolutionary politics through the eyes of these leaders, and against a political backdrop of a series of traumatic events, wars, and betrayals, Marisa Linton portrays the Jacobins as complex human beings who were influenced by emotions and personal loyalties, as well as by their revolutionary ideology.<br><br>The Jacobin leaders' entire political careers were constrained by their need to be seen by their supporters as 'men of virtue', free from corruption and ambition, and concerned only with the public good. In the early stages of the Revolution, being seen as 'men of virtue' empowered the Jacobin leaders, and aided them in their efforts to forge their political careers. However, with the onset of war, there was a growing conviction that political leaders who feigned virtue were 'the enemy within', secretly conspiring with France's external enemies. By year two, the year of the Terror, the Jacobin identity had become a destructive force: in order to demonstrate their own authenticity, they had to be seen to act virtuously, and be prepared, if the public good demanded it, to denounce and destroy their friends, and even to sacrifice their own lives. This desperate thinking resulted in the politicians' terror, one of the most ruthless of all forms of terror during the Revolution. <em>Choosing Terror</em> seeks neither to cast blame, nor to exonerate, but to understand the process whereby such things can happen.<br></p><p><br><strong>Marisa Linton</strong> is a leading historian of the French Revolution. She is currently Reader in History at Kingston University. She has published widely on eighteenth-century France and the French Revolution. She is the author of <em>The Politics of Virtue in Enlightenment France</em> (2001) and the co-editor of <em>Conspiracy in the French Revolution</em> (2007).<br><br>"[O]ffers readers a fuller understanding of the dynamics of radicalization and violence than has previously been understood. Through it, we gain insight into the emotional experience of the Revolution and the degree to which its leaders were both ruthless politicians and at the same time struggling for their survival against enormous odds."--Sarah Horowitz, <em>Journal of Modern History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Information Literacy and Information Skills Instruction: Applying Research to Practice in the 21st Century School Library</h2><p><p>This book provides a comprehensive review of the current research relating to the teaching of library and information literacy skills as part of effective school library media center programming.</p><p><br>� 30 illustrations and tables are provided to supplement the text</p><p>� A bibliography includes references and sources for cited research</p><p>� Two indexes provide quick reference by author's name and subject</p></p><p><p>What are the current best practices for information literacy instruction?

Through close analysis of German views of the East from 1800 to our own times, <em>The German Myth of the East</em> reveals that this crucial international relationship has in fact been integral to how Germans have defined (and repeatedly redefined) themselves and their own national identity. In particular, what was ultimately at stake for Germans was their own uncertain position in Europe, between East and West. Paradoxically, the East came to be viewed as both an attractive land of unlimited potential for the future and as a place undeveloped, dangerous, wild, dirty, and uncultured. <br> <br> Running the gamut from the messages of international understanding announced by generations of German scholars and sympathetic writers, to the violent racial utopia envisaged by the Nazis, German imaginings of the East represent a crucial, yet unfamiliar, part of modern European history, and one that remains fundamentally important today in the context of an expanded European Union.<br></p><p><br><strong>Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius</strong> is an Associate Professor in the Department of History at the University of Tennessee and is the author of <em>War Land on the Eastern Front: Culture, National Identity, and German Occupation in World War I</em> (2000).

Ingrid Monson juxtaposes musicians' talk and musical examples to ask how musicians go about "saying something" through music in a way that articulates identity, politics, and race. Through interviews with Jaki Byard, Richard Davis, Sir Roland Hanna, Billy Higgins, Cecil McBee, and others, she develops a perspective on jazz improvisation that has "interactiveness" at its core, in the creation of music through improvisational interaction, in the shaping of social communities and networks through music, and in the development of cultural meanings and ideologies that inform the interpretation of jazz in twentieth-century American cultural life.<br> <br> Replete with original musical transcriptions, this broad view of jazz improvisation and its emotional and cultural power will have a wide audience among jazz fans, ethnomusicologists, and anthropologists.<br></p></p><p><b>Ingrid Monson</b> is assistant professor of music at Washington University.<br></p><h2>Lost Land of the Dodo: The Ecological History of Mauritius, R�union, and Rodrigues</h2><p><p><b>A fascinating new perspective on the extinction of the ill-fated dodo and many other native species on the Mascarene Islands</b><br><br> Uninhabited by humans, the Mascarene Islands of the Indian Ocean were once home to an extraordinary range of birds and reptiles: giant tortoises, parrots, skinks, geckos, burrowing boas, flightless rails and herons, and, most famously, dodos. But the discovery of the three isolated islands in the 1500s, and their colonization in the 1600s, led to dramatic ecological changes. The dodo became extinct on its home island of Mauritius within several decades, and over the next 150 years most native vertebrates suffered the same fate.

She also maintains a private psychotherapy practice.This is a lucid exposition of John Bowlby's theory of attachment and its implications for clinical practice, with a comprehensive review of recent research and theory derived from Bowlby's work. Both the discussion of the diagnostic significance of early attachment experiences, and suggestions on how to use attachment theory in practice are wise, insightful, and profoundly important. (Peter Marris, Yale University, author of The Politics of Uncertainty: Attachment in Private and Public Life)<br><br>Despite its huge influence within psychology and child development, attachment theory has made slow inroads in the world of psychotherapy with adults. One of Bowlby's early American collaborators, Pat Sable has been working in this field for thirty years, and has at last produced the book her friends and colleagues have been waiting for. Sable is the perfect Bowlbian: her calm, trustworthy, unpretentious yet scholarly voice comes through in every page of this immensely readable volume. She takes the reader through the main areas of psychotherapeutic work, showing first how attachment theory can illuminate existing theory, and then offering vivid and compassionate case histories, in which the basic attachment features of consistency, attunement, and availability are equal in therapeutic importance to the specific interventions that brand name therapies love to claim as the mutative ingredient. This is a book for students and advanced practitioners alike, and one that no open-minded contemporary psychotherapist can afford to be without. (Jeremy Holmes, M.D., FRCPsych, author of Attachment, Intimacy, Autonomy)<br><br>Attachment theory is now the dominant model of human development available to science, and yet the clinical applications of the theory have remained elusive.

The choice of which documents include in a single volume and which to set aside is by no means easy. How much to include of those documents that make the short list is another difficult editorial challenge. Although historical documents from previous centuries are included, this collection is not intended to be a comprehensive diplomatic history. Because of the single-volume constraint, our purpose is to provide only a selective documentary record on which to base an understanding of the factors that influence American foreign and national security policy processes, decisions, and actions. </p> <p> To assist the reader, we have taken the liberty to italicize those parts of the documents that we have identified either as keys to understanding American foreign policy and national security in general or as the main points of the document. Although space limitations preclude reprinting most of the documents in their entirety (except those of particular significance such as the U.S. Constitution and the United Nations Charter), readers may find reading the original, full-text versions of many of these and other documents worthwhile. Indeed, many of these documents also address important matters beyond the scope of this volume's focus on matters of foreign policy and national security interest. </p> <p> Brief introductions before each document as well as an index facilitate use of this volume. Organized by topic, we have grouped the documents categorically into flue parts and eighteen chapters. We begin in Part 1 with foreign policy and national security aspects of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century documents related to constituting the American republic. Constitutional interpretations on the actual conduct of American foreign and national security policy are the focus of Part 2-the federal role in relation to states on such matters, separation of powers and treaties, executive-legislative understandings on war powers, and civil liberties in wartime. In Part 3 we turn to actual foreign and national security policy "statements" of lasting or present-day importance, grouped chronologically in five separate chapters (viz., pre-World War II, World War II and its settlement, the onset of cold war, the cold war itself, and the post-cold war period to date). Part 4 takes up a substantial number of arms control agreements in three chapters organized categorically&#x2014;controlling armaments themselves by institutionalizing qualitative and quantitative measures, establishing geographic (or spatial) prohibitions or limitations, and routinizing various functional measures. Finally, in Part 5 we look at American foreign policy and national security institutions and processes in two last chapters cast separately at domestic and international levels of analysis&#x2014;one on the National Security Council and the Departments of State, Defense, and Homeland Security and the other on a select few of the international organizations to which the United States has joined or was instrumental in forming&#x2014;the League of Nations, United Nations, Organization of American States, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and North American Free Trade Agreement. </p> <p> The editor deeply appreciates the assistance others have given him in this project. This began with Michelle Viotti s early help with identifying those parts of the Federalist Papers that deal with foreign policy and national security. Organization assistance and discussions with Radia d'Aoussi and other students in the Graduate School of International Studies, University of Denver, helped in the difficult process of identifying and then narrowing the list of documents that should be included in this single volume. The editor also acknowledges beneficial discussions with Paul Viotti, Jr., and the encouragement offered by his friends and colleagues-Mark Kauppi and David Goldfischer, as well as the efforts of those who agreed to review parts of the manuscript in which they have particular expertise&#x2014;Claude d'Estree, Jeffrey Larsen, James Smith, Bernard Udis, and David Viotti. </p> <p> Many thanks to the following reviewers of this text: Fred Hertrich, Middlesex County College; Carlos Yordan, Visiting Assistant Professor, Hamilton College; Robert Blanton, University of Memphis; and William Kelly, Auburn University.

The system was reconstructed from ancient Vedic sources by the late Bharati Krsna Tirthaji earlier this century and is based on a small collection of sutras. Each sutra briefly encapsulates a rule of mental working, a principle or guiding maxim. Through simple practice of these methods all may become adept and efficient at mathematics. Book I of the series is intended for primary schools in which many of the fundamental concepts of mathematics are introduced. It has been written from the classroom experience of teaching Vedic mathematics to eight and nine years-old. At this age a few of the Vedic methods are used, the rest being introduced at a later stage.</p><h2>To Speak is Never Neutral</h2><p>Feminist philosopher, linguist, and psychoanalyst Luce Irigaray is renowned for her analyses of language, studies that can be precise and poetic at the same time. In this volume of her work on language, linguistics, and psychoanalysis, she is concerned with developing a model that can reveal those unconscious or pre-conscious structures that determine speech. A key element of her method is the comparison of spoken and written language, through which she teases out the sexual and social configurations of speech.</p><p><strong>Luce Irigaray</strong> is a leading philosopher and feminist thinker, best known for <em>Speculum of the Other Woman</em> and <em>This Sex Which Is Not One.</em> More recently she has published <em>I Love to You</em> and <em>To Be Two</em> (both available from Routledge).&#34;To Speak is Never Neutral is a most important and thought-provoking contribution to our understanding of how scientific language functions. Dispelling once and for all the notion that scientific language is objective, Luce Irigaray unveils the gendered - and, crucially, the prejudicial - dimensions of a range of psychoanalytic discourses. Challenging and provocative, this book is also a significant ethical intervention into debates both about how we speak today and about how content itself is never neutral.&#34; - Michael Worton, University College London</p><h2>Rubens and Brueghel: A Working Friendship (Getty Trust Publications: J. Paul Getty Museum)</h2><p>Truly collaborative paintings, that is, not simply mechanical but also <em>conceptual</em> co-productions, are rare in the history of art. This gorgeously illustrated catalogue explores just such an extraordinary partnership between Antwerp's most eminent painters of the early seventeenth century, Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640) and Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568-1625). Rubens and Brueghel executed approximately twenty-five works together between around 1597 and Brueghel's death in 1625. Highly prized and sought after by collectors throughout Europe, the collaborative works of Rubens and Brueghel were distinguished by an extremely high level of quality, further enhanced by the status of the artists themselves.<br> Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Getty Museum to be held July 5 to September 24, 2006, the catalogue features twenty-six color plates of such Rubens/Brueghel paintings as <em>The Return from War, The Feast of Achelo�s</em>, and <em>Madonna and Child in a Garland of Flowers</em>, along with Rubens and Brueghel's collaborations with important contemporaries such as Frans Snyders and Hendrick van Balen.

A multicultural society needs a multicultural literature.This volume on Ralph Waldo Emerson and Margaret Fuller will be the first anthology to combine Emerson&#39;s and Fuller&#39;s writings, thereby making certain that teachers and students using this book will be aware of men&#39;s and women&#39;s contributions to American Transcendentalism. In this same way, the volume focuses on the debates and conflicts among the Transcendentalists about such political questions as abolition, women&#39;s rights, westward expansion, and industrialization. This volume will represent effectively the struggles of Emerson and Fuller to change their philosophical views in response to the political crises of their times.<br>"Of the most readily available anthologies of Emerson's work, Poirier's entry is by far the handsomest, most visually appealing of them all....But if one dives more deeply into the collection, one is similarly impressed with its substance....As a package this anthology is nothing less than impressive. It is undoubtedly the collection I will order the next time I teach a substantial amount of Emerson."--<em>Nineteenth-Century Prose</em><p></p><br>"This volume immediately becomes a leading contender when anyone is choosing a fully representative yet affordable anthology of Emerson."--<em>American Literature</em><p></p><br>"A solid, well-balanced collection that covers all the standard essays/poems, yet offers a refreshing selection of less-often seen materials."--Fred Erisman, <em>Texas Christian University</em><p></p><br>"This convenient but copious volume can be strongly recommended for use as either class text or library reader."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"Very valuable indeed!"--E.N.

Now there is: the second edition of this classic. M. Phyllis Lose, V.M.D., internationally respected for her knowledge and expertise in equine medicine, has revised and updated her book throughout to take into account the improvements and changes that have taken place in equine pediatrics since Brood Mares was first published. Here now is the latest information on drugs, medications and immunizations and an all-new chapter on difficult births (dystocia). Dr. Lose explains the problems that can arise and how you can safely intervene and safeguard the well-being of the mare until the veterinarian arrives. She says that "problems encountered at any time can be solved in almost every case, if the owner or caretaker will learn what to avoid, how to prevent mistakes, and most important, when to summon the veterinarian." Even those with years of experience can still learn from this book, with its seventy-five all-new photographs and drawings. Dr. Lose's language is technical enough not to insult the professional breeder, yet simple enough for the first-time breeder to grasp. She speaks with unmistakable authority but also with compassion for the mare. "Cows and women are tough," she says, "mares are delicate." The dual goals of a successful birth and a well-cared-for mare and foal are more likely to be achieved when you have this extraordinary book giving you all the help you're likely to need.The Howell Equestrian Library is a distinguished collection of books on all aspects of horsemanship and horsemastership.

The book also explores the major attempts to explain the extinctions. Because some believe that they were due to the activities of human hunters, the author also reviews the archaeological evidence left by the earliest known human occupants of the Great Basin, showing that people were here at the same time and in the same places as many of the extinct animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Were these animals abundant in the Great Basin? A detailed analysis of the distinctive assemblages of plants that now live in this region leads to a surprising, and perhaps controversial, conclusion about those abundances.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> If you are interested in Ice Age mammals or in the Ice Age archaeology of North America, if you are interested in the natural history of the Great Basin or the ways in which the plants of today&#x2019;s landscapes might be used to understand the deeper past, you will be fascinated by this book. &nbsp;</p><p><b>Donald K.

One of the leading scholars of ancient thought, Benardete here reflects on both the people he knew and the topics that fascinated him throughout his career in a series of candid, freewheeling conversations with Robert Berman, Ronna Burger, and Michael Davis.<br> The first part of the book discloses vignettes about fellow students, colleagues, and acquaintances of Benardete's who later became major figures in the academic and intellectual life of twentieth-century America. We glimpse the student days of Allan Bloom, Stanley Rosen, George Steiner, and we discover the life of the mind as lived by well-known scholars such as David Grene, Jacob Klein, and Benardete's mentor Leo Strauss. We also encounter a number of other learned, devoted, and sometimes eccentric luminaries, including T.S. Eliot, James Baldwin, Werner Jaeger, John Davidson Beazley, and Willard Quine. In the book's second part, Benardete reflects on his own intellectual growth and on his ever-evolving understanding of the texts and ideas he spent a lifetime studying. Revisiting some of his recurrent themes&#x2014;among them eros and the beautiful, the city and the law, and the gods and the human soul&#x2014;Benardete shares his views on thinkers such as Plato, Homer, and Heidegger, as well as the relations between philosophy and science and between Christianity and ancient Roman thought.<br><br> Engaging and informative, <i>Encounters and Reflections</i> brings Benardete's thought to life to enlighten and inspire a new generation of thinkers.</p><p><b>Seth Benardete</b> (1930-2001) was professor of classics at New York University.

Benardete, the classical scholar and philosopher who died last year, sat down in the early 1990s with three of his students to recapture their conversations of twenty years before. The resulting discussions are both spontaneous and well ordered; a lovely achievement brought about by the editor's skill, Benardete's wizardy, and the familiarity of friends. . . . One by one our intellectual giants disappear, and their memories seem to shrivel in the gloomy and endless cave of our mediocrity. It is more hopeful to say instead that in books like this they continue to glow.

Authors synthesize the scholarly debates and analysis of Luther's thinking and point to future areas of research and exploration of his thought.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert Kolb</strong> is Professor of Systematic Theology emeritus at Concordia Seminary.<br><br><strong>Irene Dingel</strong> is Professor of Church History and the History of Dogma at Johannes Gutenberg University.<br><br><strong>L'ubomir Batka</strong> is Dean of Lutheran Theological Faculty at Comenius University.<br><br>"This volume is certainly a fine example of historical scholarship this is an incredibly useful work, and will be useful to any scholar who has interest in Luther and his historical context."--Harrison Perkins, <em>Anglican and Episcopal History</em><p></p><br>"Oxford University Press's series of handbooks has established itself as a go-to resource for high-quality, up-to-date treatments of scholarly topics across a wide range of academic disciplines, and this volume on <em>Martin Luther's Theology</em> is a worthy edition to the series...

In this book, Carl Smith explores the imaginative dimensions of these events as he traces the evolution of beliefs that increasingly linked city, disorder, and social reality in the minds of Americans. Studying a remarkable range of writings and illustrations, as well as protests, public gatherings, trials, hearings, and urban reform and construction efforts, Smith argues that these three events&#x2014;and the public awareness of the them&#x2014;not only informed one another, but collectively shaped how Americans saw, and continue to see, the city.</p><p><b>Carl Smith</b> is the Franklyn Bliss Snyder Professor of English and American Studies and professor of history at Northwestern University.

Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practiced by literature's greatest writers. In the Art Of The Novella series, Melville House celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances, presented in book form for the first time.</p><p><b>Samuel Johnson</b> was born in 1709 above his father's bookshop in Lichfield, England. He was a sickly child, scarred by smallpox, with facial and vocal tics, likely symptoms of Tourette Syndrome. But he proved a brilliant student, attending Oxford until a lack of funds forced his departure. (Numerous honorary degrees would later justify his famous sobriquet "Dr." Johnson.) At twenty-five he married Elizabeth "Tetty" Potter, a well-off widow twenty-one years his senior. She funded a school Johnson started, but lost much of her wealth when the school failed. Wracked by guilt, Johnson walked to London and, living virtually on the street, began writing reviews, essays and news for magazines, notably <i>The Idler</i> and <i>The Rambler</i>. In 1744, he published his masterpiece, <i>Life Of Savage</i>, an innovative warts-and-all biography of his friend, writer Richard Savage. Johnson would write several more "lives," culminating in his acclaimed three-volume <i>Lives of The Poets</i>. In 1746 a group of publishers asked Johnson to compile an authoritative English dictionary. He completed the massive undertaking in 1755, and <i>A Dictionary of the English Language</i> would set the standard for the next 150 years. Upon his death in 1784 he was buried in Westminster Abbey. Yet his fame only rose when, in 1791, his friend James Boswell published became the most famous "life" of them all: <i>Life of Samuel Johnson</i>."I wanted them all, even those I'd already read."<br> <b>&#x2014;Ron Rosenbaum, </b><i><b>The New York Observer</b></i><br> <br> "Small wonders."<br> <b>&#x2014;</b><i><b>Time Out London</b></i><br> <br> <i>"</i>[F]irst-rate...astutely selected and attractively packaged...indisputably great works."<br> <b>&#x2014;Adam Begley, </b><i><b>The New York Observer</b></i><br> <br> "I&#x2019;ve always been haunted by Bartleby, the proto-slacker.

Each of the sections is edited by a different reputable scholar. The writing is dry but accessible, and the illustrations (usually in color) are sharp and easy to read.

The contributors open new avenues of enquiry involving concepts of &#39;presence&#39;, &#39;projective properties&#39;, visual conventions and syntax, and the appropriateness of figurative language in accounting for visual art.

During his brief, but productive reign as &#34;enfant terrible&#34; and prodigious deity, Basquiat impacted contemporary art with an unsettling mixture of artistic resources and a personal mastery of the social nuances of his era. Collaborator with other artists such as Andy Warhol and Francesco Clemente and an influence on their work, Basquiat remains today a controversial artist of significance and excitement. The drawings in this book, published to coincide with The Whitney Museum of American Art&#39;s major retrospective of Basquiat&#39;s painting, capture all the energy, excess and conflict of the 1980s.

Lukacs describes how the German dictator tried to force the British into a compromise peace, explains why Hitler declined to destroy the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk and reveals in detail how Churchill succeeded in keeping up the fighting morale of Britain as it stood alone after the fall of France. In this masterful double-portrait Hitler is presented as a "revolutionary" and Churchill as a "reactionary," the incarnation of the resistance of the old world to "a force that was frighteningly efficient, brutal, and new." The author leaves no doubt that Churchill had a much greater understanding of his adversary than did Hitler. The third great character in the study is Franklin Roosevelt. Lukacs ( The Last European War ) analyzes the influence of the powerful isolationist bloc in the U.S. and distills the factors that led FDR to defy it, bypass Congress and order the transfer of 50 destroyers to Britain--the first formal American departure from neutrality. The book is a significant contribution to our understanding of WW II. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.This extended essay presents the confrontation between Hitler and Churchill in the summer of 1940 as the pivotal event of World War II, and of modern European history. Lukacs ( Budapest: Nineteen Hundred ) powerfully contrasts Hitler the revolutionary with Churchill the statesman. One championed a new order, a world "heroic, pagan, and scientific." The other defended the values of Western civilization. Churchill fought on against seemingly hopeless odds. Hitler refused to risk the invasion Lukacs believes might have won the war. Stalemated, each duelist sought an alternate solution. Hitler turned against the Soviet Union; Churchill turned toward the United States. The immediate result was Europe's eclipse, and 40 years of U.S./USSR occupation. But Europe survived, and in the long run it was the traditionalist who triumphed over the radical--a triumph highlighted by the events of 1990.

That book presented the letters of the prominent Presbyterian minister and plantation patriarch Charles Colcock Jones (1804&#x2013;1863), whose family owned more than one hundred slaves. While extensive, these letters can provide only one part of the story of the Jones family plantations in coastal Georgia. In this remarkable new book, the religious historian Erskine Clarke completes the story, offering a narrative history of four generations of the plantations&#x2019; inhabitants, white <i>and </i>black. Encompassing the years 1805 to 1869, <i>Dwelling Place: A Plantation Epic </i>describes the simultaneous but vastly different experiences of slave and slave owner. This &#x201c;upstairs-downstairs&#x201d; history reveals in detail how the benevolent impulses of Jones and his family became ideological supports for deep oppression, and how the slave Lizzy Jones and members of her family struggled against that oppression. Through letters, plantation and church records, court documents, slave narratives, archaeological findings, and the memory of the African-American community, Clarke brings to light the long-suppressed history of the slaves of the Jones plantations&#x2014;a history inseparably bound to that of their white owners.</p></p><p>Q: You&#x2019;ve been working on this book for a decade. How did you first come to this story?<p></p>A: <i>I began my research with the intention of writing a biography of Charles Colcock Jones, Sr. The monumental collection of the Jones family letters in </i>Children of Pride <i>covered only the last part of Jones&#x2019;s life, but did not include the critical earlier years of his work among the Gullah people of the Georgia coast. The family papers included thousands of letters, extensive plantation records, journals, sermons preached to slaves, and documents describing slave life. A fascinating story of a wealthy, pious, and influential low-country community began to emerge. The Jones family, like many of their white planting neighbors, were highly literate, deeply committed to the public good of their white community, and convinced that slavery provided a necessary training period for African Americans on their way to some distant freedom.<p></p></i>Q: While the stories of white plantation owners are fairly well documented, the lives of their slaves are not. How did you reconstruct the lives of these individuals?<p></p>A: <i>As I moved deeper into the documents, I began to discover individual African Americans emerging into plain view individuals with names, with histories, with distinctive traits and varied ways of resisting the deep oppression of slavery. While I knew that a great distance separated me from these Gullah people, I felt an increasing compulsion to try as best I could to tell their story too. And so I decided to attempt a kind of upstairs-downstairs history.<p></p>One story would be told from the perspective of whites who saw the low country from the piazzas of plantation homes. The other story would be told from the perspective of blacks who saw it from around the communal fires of slave settlements. In the end, I found I could not write a biography of Charles Jones without also writing about the life and struggles of Cato and Cassius, Patience and Phoebe, and the dense network of Gullah people who in their labors and resistance to slavery built their own remarkable community and culture.<p></p></i><p><b>Erskine Clarke</b> is professor of American religious history, Columbia Theological Seminary.</p></p><h2>The Human Age: The World Shaped By Us</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the National Outdoor Book Award and the PEN New England Henry David Thoreau Prize.<br><br> A dazzling, inspiring tour through the ways that humans are working with nature to try to save the planet.</strong></p><p>With her celebrated blend of scientific insight, clarity, and curiosity, Diane Ackerman explores our human capacity both for destruction and for invention as we shape the future of the planet Earth.

In 1534 he published&nbsp;<i>Gargantua</i>, a companion to&nbsp;<i>Pantagruel</i>, which contains some of his best work. It mocks old-fashioned theological education, and opposes the monastic ideal, contrasting it with a free society of noble Evangelicals.

A happy event was needed to melt the gloom and free everyone from the depression that hung over the community. The consecration as bishop of a priest who was loved by almost everyone was that event. The previous weeks, and months, had been cold and dismal, but this day seemed to make up for it all. The weather was perfect. The sun bright and warm, the crisp air fresh from the morning dew, the cool, blue sky with hardly a cloud, all hinted of an early summer. Happy voices filled the air. The sidewalks surrounding the massive Gothic cathedral were teeming with people of every race and religion. An unusual number of Jews, some with beards and long black coats, mingled with their friends; at a distance from them in another section of the crowd was a small group of Muslims, a handful wearing fezzes. There was a sprinkling of Oriental people, too. It was hard to imagine all of these people fitting into the building even as vast as it was, but its huge, bronze-framed doorways swallowed them all as they poured through.<br><br>Tommy Burns was a squat, thickly built Irishman. He and his wife, Emily, were walking toward the cathedral next to a rabbi. Tommy was curious as to why a rabbi, especially the old-fashioned kind, was going to a Catholic bishop's consecration. Never reserved, Tommy asked him.<br><br>"Rabbi, if I am not being ignorant or too forward, why would a man like yourself be coming to a bishop's consecration?" Tommy asked bluntly.<br><br>The rabbi, taken aback, answered simply, "Because he is much more than a bishop to me. Our congregation will always be indebted to David Campbell. When the state was going to take away our synagogue to build a highway, David used his influence with the governor's office to have the course of the highway moved. He is like one of our family. He visits and prays with us on many Friday nights. It is as if one of our own was being made bishop. Perhaps you could tell me why you have come to his consecration."<br><br>Tommy grinned. "About six months ago I lost my job and couldn't keep up the mortgage payments on my house. The bank was starting foreclosure proceedings. My wife and I were beside ourselves. If we couldn't afford the mortgage we wouldn't be able to afford rent either. We had nightmares about being thrown out in the streets with our five kids. Mysteriously the money appeared, enough to pay the mortgage until I was able to find a job. It was only later we found out that it was Father Campbell who had sent the money through one of my cousins whom he knows, and that he had sold his own car to raise the money. I'll never be able to pay him back, but I was told he didn't want it back. You don't come across people like that very often. Some people say he's tough when it comes to Church matters, but I can't imagine it."<br><br>By that time the two were approaching the entrance to the church. The street was still crowded. Uniformed policemen had difficulty keeping clear the walkway from the rectory so the procession could advance in orderly fashion. As the bells tolled in powerful bursts of joyful exuberance, the procession emerged from the rectory. First came the deacon bearing the Book of the Gospels, its gold and jeweled cover glistening in the sun. He was followed by altar boys and girls, then the part of the choir that was not already in the church, and ranks of clergy of various denominations, including Orthodox bishops in their unusual trappings. Then emerged the consecrating bishops and Archbishop O'Connell from the neighboring archdiocese. Last was the bishop-elect, David Campbell, with his two assisting priests.<br><br>Father Campbell was impressive in his priestly robes. He was tall and not powerfully built, but scholarly-looking. His walnut-colored hair was slightly wavy, and his metal-rimmed glasses accented his intellectual appearance.<br><br>His long, tapering fingers moved gracefully as he waved to people lining the procession route, a shy smile etching his finely chiseled features. His thin face showed the strain he had been under since his call to the bishopric. A long, thin nose of precise proportion was set between warm, penetrating brown eyes that smiled easily, betraying a kind peacefulness beneath the surface. His look seemed to linger rather than move rapidly, hinting at a thoughtfulness that absorbed everything, weighing carefully, never forgetting. David was not a simple man. What appeared on the surface of his life gave no indication of the wholly different world that existed beneath, into which he would not allow even his most intimate friends to penetrate.<br><br>As the procession moved into the church, working its way up the aisle, the organ music stopped and the choir intoned the processional, magnified by the almost two thousand happy voices that filled the vast, vaulting sanctuary. Many of the bishops were smiling to people they recognized as they walked up the aisle. The bishop-elect, his hands folded with palms pressed together, seemed unaware of anything around him. His eyes looked straight ahead but not seeing, as if he were absorbed in thoughts of things far away, or deep within.<br><br>As the procession approached the sanctuary, only the officiating bishops and their assistants entered, together with the bishop-elect and his two assisting priests. He was seated before the altar facing the congregation.<br><br>"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit," the archbishop intoned. The congregation roared its "Amen." "My brothers and sisters," he continued, "we have come here today from many places and many backgrounds, but all as God's children. He is very much present here with us as we prepare for the consecration of our friend David as bishop. As we call upon our Father to witness and consecrate what we do, we humbly acknowledge our own sins and failings, and beg for His forgiveness. Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Lord, have mercy."<br><br>The Liturgy of the Word continued, and after the Gospel, the ordination of the bishop-elect took place. The choir sang <i>"Veni, Creator Spiritus":</i> "Come, Creator Spirit, touch the minds of these your children, fill with your heavenly grace these hearts you have created."<br><br>During the singing of the hymn, David was led by his assistants to the place of consecration.<br><br>"Most Reverend Father," one of the priests addressed the archbishop, "the Church of this diocese asks you to ordain this priest, David, for service as bishop."<br><br>"Have you the mandate from the Holy See?" the archbishop asked.<br><br>"We have."<br><br>After the letter was read, the archbishop addressed the whole assembly. "Consider carefully the position in the Church to which our brother is about to be raised. Our Lord Jesus Christ, who was sent by the Father to redeem the human race, in turn sent twelve apostles into the world. These men were filled with the power of the Holy Spirit to preach the Gospel to every race and people into a single flock to be guided in the way of holiness. Because this service was to be until the end of time, the apostles selected others to help them. By the laying on of hands which confers the sacrament in its fullness, the apostles passed on the gift of the Holy Spirit, which they themselves had received from Christ. In that way, by a succession of bishops unbroken from one generation to the next, the powers conferred in the beginning were handed down, and the work of the Savior lives and grows in our time." Then, looking at David, he continued, "You, dear brother, have been chosen by the Lord to guide His people. You have been chosen to serve rather than to rule, and to proclaim the good news of Jesus endlessly. You are called to be a good shepherd in imitation of the Master. Love all those entrusted to you' the poor, the sick, the weak, strangers, and the homeless, as well as those who are rich in the things of this world. May your own life be blameless and a shining reflection of the goodness of Jesus Himself. And may God have mercy on your soul, as you accept this awesome responsibility."<br><br>The liturgy, stripped of all the medieval pageantry that had once characterized these ceremonies, was still impressive. The rich traditions of the Church, the unbroken line of priestly power and authority that Jesus had given to His apostles and which He had intended should be passed on forever, were reflected in every facet of the beautiful and timeless rite. David could trace his own spiritual lineage to one of the apostles through the unbroken line of succession. It was a graphic expression of the organic bond between the Church of every age with the living Christ who walked the roads of Palestine.<br><br>After all the preliminary interrogations and prayers, the bishops laid their hands on David as he knelt before them. With the Book of the Gospels held above his head, the archbishop recited the prayer of consecration over him: "...Father, pour out Your Spirit upon Your chosen, that he may be a shepherd of Your holy flock and a high priest blameless in Your sight. Grant him every power You bestowed upon the apostles themselves, so he may carry on their work in our time. May he be pleasing to You by his gentleness and purity of heart, presenting a fragrant offering to You, through Jesus Your Son."<br><br>After the consecration, the symbols of office were presented: the Book of the Gospels, the ring, the miter, and the shepherd's staff. The Mass continued as usual, but when the ceremony ended, thunderous applause spontaneously erupted, attesting to the extraordinary popularity of this quiet and unassuming cleric.<br><br>It was difficult for many of David's colleagues to understand the reason for his popularity, since his recent assignments were not high profile situations in which he could cultivate a following. He worked part-time at the chancery, where he had a reputation for exact observance of Church law. When people called for help with difficult predicaments, he would always listen, but if help demanded bending any of the rules or countermanding canon law, he could be uncompromising. Many people left hurt and more alienated from the Church than before they came to see him. He could be cold and detached when applying the law. The book was everything. That was most probably the reason he was selected to be bishop. He was predictable and dedicated to what was expected of a loyal Church official.<br><br>Two women on the chancery staff summed it up as they gossiped while exiting the church. "How do you explain why there are so many unusual people here today?" Joan Carey asked the chancery receptionist, Marilyn Cotugno. Joan was not one of David's most avid fans. "I'll never get over the way he handled my sister's case when she came to him for advice. I thought that of all the priests at the chancery he would be the one most likely to understand her problem. She came home that night crying, vowing she'd never go to church again. I certainly can't see why people think he's so great. Charlie Mayberry was really upset when David's appointment was announced."<br><br>"Don't you think that was because he was jealous? Charlie would have loved to have been made bishop," Marilyn interjected.<br><br>"That's possible, but Charlie still doesn't think much of David. He's forever criticizing the way he does things and tried to get him appointed pastor just to get him out of the chancery."<br><br>Marilyn liked David and wasn't about to let him be hacked at like this even by her friend. "Well, how do you explain the unusual demonstration of affection today?"<br><br>"It's beyond me," Joan answered with a look of bewilderment.<br><br>"Perhaps it's from people he works with in his free time," Marilyn put in by way of David's defense. "He does have a reputation for quietly working with all kinds of people, non-Catholics included, and for helping people in trouble. I'll never forget the time he took a part-time job on the docks to earn money to buy food for poor families whose income was so little they could hardly survive. My Jewish friends tell me he goes to their synagogue on Friday nights and says his prayers in Hebrew. Even Muslims like him because he fights with immigration on behalf of family members who had been refused entrance into the country on technicalities. You have to admit he's shrewd the way he uses his contacts. I think that's the real David. What we see in the chancery is the company man who always goes by the book, but that's what's expected of him. I'm sure that's the reason he was made bishop, because he was such a good company man. I think we are really going to get a surprise once he gets a chance to be himself."<br><br>Marilyn wasn't far from wrong. It was for the thorough and faithful performance of his official responsibilities that David was now being rewarded by the Church.<br><br>The ceremony over, the clergy met at the cathedral rectory briefly, then departed for the civic center for the lavish dinner and gala festivities. The governor was there, along with other state officials and dignitaries from faraway places. People obviously thought much of and expected much from this new celebrity; they felt honored to have been invited to his ordination.<br><br>David was unusually quiet at the dinner, although he talked warmly and politely to everyone, graciously expressing his gratitude to each for attending and for the good wishes. As the day wore on one could see the strain in his face and sense his need to be away from the crowd, alone.<br><br>That is just what he did when it all ended. A man other than David might have preferred further celebration and camaraderie; but after thanking the archbishop and all the other bishops, he left for his home to spend the night alone.<br><br>After falling into a deep sleep on the couch for a few hours, he woke up and had a drink. Then he went to his room and knelt at his prie-dieu, which faced a stark reproduction of the Crucifixion by El Greco. As he knelt, his face resting in his hands, he became absorbed in his thoughts.<br><br>"O, my God, what have I done? What have I taken upon myself? For years I sensed this day would come, and as it approached I became more and more fearful. If only they had known the visions, the thoughts, the conflicts that haunted me, they would never have done this. Now I am here and there is no turning back. For the rest of my life I must live this calling, not as others see it, but as I, under the light of Your grace, understand it. Help me, God, I am frightened. Jesus, Good Shepherd, teach me. I will follow You faithfully wherever You may lead. Only guide me, I am afraid."<br><br>David prayed intermittently. At intervals his mind wandered. He did not know whether he had fallen off to sleep and had dreamed dreams, or whether in his openness to God, God was speaking to him.<br><br>One dream -- or revelation or vision -- was particularly disturbing. A woman, troubled and crying, a look of haunting anguish on her face, was pointing at David. "You have done this to me. You have done this to me. I trusted you as I trusted God and you turned me away. Now see my children. Look at them, see what has happened to them, and all because of you." Two children appeared in the dream, boys in their late teens, angry children, throwing stones at a church and turning to David with the accusation, "Righteous priest, god without a heart. If that's what he's like, you keep him. We'll have none of him."<br><br>David recognized the woman and the boys. She had come to him years ago with a problem. Her husband had left her and abandoned the children. In her loneliness, she had found a man who cared for her and was devoted to the children. They in turn loved him as a father. The woman had been raised in a rigidly traditional family and was troubled over the affair. She decided to tell David the whole story.

He has made a lifelong study of maritime history and archaeology, and the history of early European development. He is a museum professional with experience in both Britain and the United States, and holds degrees in history and archaeology.<p>Gr 9 Up-This resource barely qualifies as an atlas; almost half of the 79 double-page chapters contain no map(s) whatsoever. Konstam reviews the activities, achievements, and personalities of the medieval age from 500 to 1500, with an overemphasis on France, England, and Italy. There are numerous full-color photographs of sites and reproductions, but the writing is dull and sometimes confusing. The chapter divisions don't always make sense, and result in an overall lack of flow and connectedness. There is no glossary. The maps that are included are incomplete and frequently omit places mentioned in the text. Although it's not an atlas, Barbara Hanawalt's The Middle Ages (Oxford, 1998) is a readable survey that integrates daily life with history.</p><p><i>Ann W.

Beeke<br> Old Testament Editor: Michael Barrett<br> New Testament Editor: Gerald Bilkes<br>Here, at last, is the study Bible that many have been waiting for! The KJV has its strengths, but, like an old ship at sea that has had its fair share of beatings from the waves of time, it has needed a few screws tightened, especially around its antiquated words. This, plus the many introductory and explanatory notes, will make those who have grown up on the KJV grateful that in this one volume they can now do almost all their primary textual and doctrinal study. This is truly an exciting development that is long overdue! --Conrad Mbewe, pastor of Kabwata Baptist Church, Zambia<br><br>The publication of the <i>Reformation Heritage KJV Study Bible</i> arrives on the scene as other translations seek to sweep the poetry and beauty of the English language aside. The KJV is a timeless translation of the most influential and life-changing book ever to be printed on the page. You hold in your hands a book that men of great faith have given their lives to see printed in the English language. Reformation Heritage Books has done a beautiful job in compiling excellent materials for this new study Bible. Specifically, this study Bible assembles key articles defining and explaining Reformed theology from the perspective of the Reformers and Puritans. An especially valuable feature is the notes included within each chapter that encourage personal and family devotions. Read the words of this Bible, praying that God will apply the truth to your heart and life. --Steven J.

To open these pages is as if we can read our Bibles each day with a group of valuable teachers sitting round us a linguist, an exegete, a couple of theologians biblical and systematic, a church historian, a pastor, and, to help us in applying Scripture and worshiping God, some of our family and friends. What a blessing!

Yet, despite their unsavory characteristics, as we find in this <b>compulsively readable book,</b> <b>parasites have played an enormous role</b> in civilizations through time and around the globe. <i><b>Parasites: Tales of Humanity's Most Unwelcome Guests</b> </i>puts <b>amoebae, roundworms, tapeworms, mites</b>, and others at the center of the action as <b>human cultures</b> have evolved and declined. It shows their role in <b>exploration, war, and even terrorist plots</b>, often through an unpredictable ripple effect. It reveals them as <b>invisible threats in our food, water, and luggage</b>; as invaders that have shaped <b>behaviors and taboos</b>; and as unexpected partners in such venues as <b>crime scene investigations</b>. <i>Parasites </i>also describes their <b>evolution and life histories</b> and considers their significant <b>benefits</b>. Deftly blending the sociological with the scientific, this natural and social history of parasites looks closely at a fascinating, often disgusting group of organisms and discovers that they are in fact an <b>integral thread in the web of life.</b></p><p><b>Between the lines of history books,</b> we might expect to find many interesting things - anecdotes and facts that are very significant but never written down. We generally don't, however, expect to find <b>a hidden menagerie of parasites</b>. The <b>great events of history,</b> we believe, were orchestrated by humans, dictated by action and counteraction, turned by the decisions of world leaders. <b>What could parasites have to do with history?</b><br> &nbsp;&nbsp; And yet we appreciate how many of our own experiences are created by a chain of seemingly small and insignificant events that make absolute sense only when viewed in retrospect. That's how it is with parasites. By examining<b> the parasite in the context of the event</b>, this book seeks the scientific pearls that pull it all together: science can reveal how <b>exploring new territory could unleash deadly parasitic disease</b>, how <b>malaria could save the Los Angeles International Airport </b>from a terrorist, how a simple change in human<b> behavior can open the door for a parasite</b> or foil it completely.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The book looks within us as well, at our beliefs and the urban<b> legends and mythologies of parasites</b> that inform them. Most of us shudder at the thought of having <b>lice, or mites, intestinal worms</b>, or--<b>ghastly thought--worms in the brain</b>. Some of us are philosophical: lice happen. Some are obsessed. All living things are part of the web of live, but it's particularly difficult to <b>give parasites their due</b>. Who needs them?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>Parasites: Tales of Humanity's Most Unwelcome Guests</i></b> is not a book about how awful parasites are. It is a book <b>about what parasites are up to</b>, and what they have been up to for millions of years, both good and bad. Good, bad, beautiful, ugly, benign, deadly; <b>they are all... fascinating.</b>"If unfortunate circumstance prevents you from acquiring <b>parasites of your own</b>, this book is the next best thing. Sure, you'll miss the <b>itching, the hatching, the malnutrition, and the brain damage</b>, but you'll make up for that in <b>history </b>(the hookworm's view on slavery is a rarely considered perspective), <b>mystery</b> (crimes committed with creepy-crawlies), and <b>climatology </b>(global swarming alert).

From an early age he was fascinated by Spain's mixed heritage, adapting its ancient folk songs, ballads, lullabies, and flamenco music into poems and plays. By the age of thirty, he had published five books of poems, culminating in 1928 with <b>Gypsy Ballads</b>, which brought him far-reaching fame. In 1929-30 he studied in New York City, where he wrote the poems&#x2014;among his most socially engaging and compelling&#x2014;that were to be published posthumously (and famously) as Poet in New York. Upon returning to Spain he devoted much of his attention to theater, "the poetry which rises from the page . . . and becomes human." In 1936, at the outset of the Spanish Civil War, he was shot to death by anti-Republican rebels in Franco's army, and his books were banned and destroyed.&nbsp;</p><h2>Anthology for Creative Writers, An: A Garden of Forking Paths</h2><p>An Anthology for Creative Writers: A Garden of Forking Paths is a multi-genre literary anthology with extensive selections of contemporary poetry, short fiction, creative non-fiction, alternative forms, and essays about writing and the creative process.

They grouped these writings by genre for ease of use so that you can choose how you want to spend your reading time. From science writer E. O. Wilson to psychiatrist Oliver Sacks, you will find in the garden that each author has labored to articulate at least one of the seemingly infinite possibilities that the spirit can bring into being. Many of the authors in the text have successfully created works of written art using more than one genre. Beth Anstandig and Eric Killough created this text in hope that these examples will inspire your students to experiement in multiple genres as well.An Introduction to the Text "&#x2018;I shall retire to write a book,&#x2019; and at another point, &#x2018;I shall retire to construct a labyrinth.&#x2019; Everyone pictured two projects; it occurred to no one that book and labyrinth were one and the same." &#x2014;Jorge Luis Borges Excellent writing comes from excellent reading. As a student of creative writing, you must be prepared not only to constantly revise and rework your own writing but to also review, consider and implement the work of other writers. We see farthest by standing on the shoulders of those who precede us. This book aims to compile, in one volume, innovative and inspirational writing from the last four decades. The works here defy traditional categorization while delivering accessible and instructive examples of the writer&#x2019;s creative art. Jorges Luis Borges, the celebrated librarian, poet, essayist, and short story writer worked throughout his life to push the act of creative writing into strange and fruitful new territories. His work was necessitated both by his need to create as a writer and by his need to learn from what he created. As the narrator of his experimental short story, "The Garden of Forking Paths" explains, the act of creating a new written work is often carried on between the acts of making decisions and of having decisions made for you. The writer must respond to not only his or her own need to write, but to the need of the subject to be written. <p>"In all fictions", he reminds us, "each time a man meets diverse alternatives, he chooses and eliminates the others." However, in his story, we are offered an alternative. This story, "The Garden of Forking Paths" describes a book entitled "The Garden of Forking Paths", in which the main character chooses not just one alternative, but, miraculously, all alternatives simultaneously and "creates, thereby, &#x2018;several futures,&#x2019; several times, which themselves proliferate and fork." </p><p>We believe that this book is, itself, an immense (and perhaps labyrinthine) garden of forking paths that all creative writers can enter, no matter what experience they bring. There are wildly divergent writings selected within each genre, here, and their coexistence provides proof that the act of writing can take many forms. This anthology aims to represent as many of those forms as possible. There are, we hope to show, as many paths into and through the garden as there are persons willing enter and explore and to read. Furthermore, your participation in the world of creative writing will expand those paths and options even further. Poet Theodore Roethke hated the term "creative writing" because, as he said, all writing is creative. It is our hope that this anthology will provide undeniable evidence that this is true: the possibility for creativity resides in every word. Within these pages, you will find that the creative spirit rises above all genres and infuses every form with vitality and exuberance. Every aspiring writer -- whether you consider yourself a poet, an essayist, a novelist, or none-of-the-above -- when faced with the impulse to create a piece of writing, must choose the form that will best express his or her thoughts and ideas. The beginning writer faces a single, primary, two-pronged problem: what do I wish to create and how do I wish to create it? We believe there is no right answer. Rather, in these pages, you will find that there are as many right answers as there are questions. We feel that you should approach the blank page with a working knowledge of as many approaches to writing as possible. We also believe that all writers learn their craft primarily by reading excellent and inspiring writing. Within these pages, you will find that we have gathered a representative and voluminous sample of the most invigorating and creative writing today.</p><p> Guided by fiction writer, essayist, and poet Robert Creeley's belief that all writing is essentially the act of articulation and that "form is content, content form," we have brought together as many successful examples of ideas and styles as possible.

Many of the authors collected here have successfully created works of written art using more than one genre: Kim Addonizio, Jim Harrison, Margaret Atwood, Charles Simic, to name but a few.

The first edition generated much debate and controversy. This second edition contains a substantial new Afterword that responds to some of the criticisms made by scientists.

Landscapes have received much less attention in aesthetics than those arts we can choose to ignore, such as painting or music&nbsp;&#x2013; but they can tell us a lot about the ethical and aesthetic values of the societies that produce them. </p> <p>Drawing on&nbsp;examples from a wide range of landscapes from around the world and throughout history, Susan Herrington considers the ways landscapes can affect our emotions, our imaginations, and our understanding of the passage of time.<em> On Landscapes</em> reveals the design work involved in even the most naturalistic of landscapes, and the ways in which contemporary landscapes are turning the challenges of the industrial past into opportunities for the future. Inviting us to thoughtfully see and experience the landscapes that we encounter in our daily lives, <em>On Landscapes</em> demonstrates that art is all around us.</p></p><p><p>Susan Herrington is an Associate Professor of landscape architecture and environmental design at the University of British Columbia. She is also a licensed landscape architect in the United States.</p><p>"Herrington deftly and succinctly draws together a vast range of material on landscape from several disciplines. She writes engagingly without oversimplifying; she thinks carefully without losing sight of the lay of the land. Both lay readers and professionals will come away from this small gem looking at and living in the landscape in new ways." <br><strong>&#x2013;Bruce Janz, University of Central Florida, USA</strong></p> <p>"[Herrington's] focus on contemporary landscapes is a fresh approach that is commendable in its scope as well as being rich, informative and accessibly written. While it draws on diverse philosophical perspectives it also draws on an impressive range of interdisciplinary sources. <em>On Landscapes</em> is an indispensable starting point for anyone who wants to think seriously about landscapes."<br>-<em><strong>Environmental Values</strong></em></p></p><h2>Canadian Folk Art: Old Ways in a New Land by Michael Bird (1984-04-03)</h2><p>hardcover with dust jacket</p><p></p><h2>Beat This!

In this book, Spy magazine&#39;s original food columnist throws down the gauntet with a solid collection of can&#39;t-fail recipes that most readers will find irresistible - and unbeatable. Whether it&#39;s for cheesecake, crab cakes, chicken salad, blueberry pie, beef stew, or fudge, the author takes all-time North American favorite dishes and pulls out all the stops.</p><p>Ann Hodgman is author of more than forty children&#39;s books, several humor books, and the BEAT THIS! and BEAT THAT! cookbooks. She has two children and twenty pets. Ann Hodgman lives in Washington, Connecticut.<p>INTRODUCTION</p> <p>Why are people always so proud of their brownie<br>recipes? Katharine Hepburn, for example. If there&#x2019;s anything<br>I&#x2019;m sick of&#x2014;besides the way she always says she&#x2019;s a regular<br>person and not an actress&#x2014;it&#x2019;s reading about how sinful her<br>brownies are. Actually, Hepburn&#x2019;s is the dullest brownie formula there is, and<br>one of the most common. There&#x2019;s a copy of it in my daughter&#x2019;s nursery-school<br>cookbook (prefaced by the remark, &#x201c;These are sinful&#x201d;); there&#x2019;s a copy of it in two<br>different Junior League cookbooks I own; there&#x2019;s a copy of it in Fannie Farmer.<br>All these recipes for an utterly undistinguished product! I guess sin is duller<br>than I thought.<br>&nbsp;Brownies aren&#x2019;t the only food for which people always think their recipe is<br>the best. Another one is meat loaf. Ann Landers gets hundreds of requests for<br>her meat loaf recipe, which is strange considering that it, too, is ordinary in the<br>extreme. (Ground meat, ketchup, onion soup mix&#x2014;you get the picture.) There&#x2019;s<br>a whole feedlot of recipes out there with self-awarded blue ribbons. But it&#x2019;s rare<br>to find a &#x201c;best&#x201d; recipe that&#x2019;s even worth reading&#x2014;much less eating.<br>&nbsp;Except for the ones in this book. These really are the best. There&#x2019;s just no<br>point in trying any other recipes but these. I mean, there&#x2019;s just no point in trying<br>any other recipes for these foods but these. What I mean is, these are the<br>best recipes of their type. Well, you know what I mean. I guess I mean, if you&#x2019;re<br>looking for a blini recipe, my chili recipe won&#x2019;t do you much good. But if you&#x2019;re<br>looking for a chili recipe, it will. Know what I mean?<br>I&#x2019;m not very good at coming up with original recipes, although my daughter<br>Laura is. One of my favorites is one she composed when she was five:</p> <p>Plain Dough<br>Sugar<br>Raisins<br>Any fruit<br>Cookit</p> <p>&nbsp;Unlike Laura, I can&#x2019;t just walk into the kitchen and improvise a brilliant new<br>dish. But I can figure out how to improve a recipe. I just double the chocolate<br>and add some bacon.<br>&nbsp;Of course it&#x2019;s a little more complicated than that. Still, some of the recipes<br>in this book wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily be considered healthy. Lots of them, I guess.<br>But the best recipes are rarely the healthiest. When you&#x2019;re looking for the best<br>potato salad to take to a potluck (page 188), or the best blueberry pie to bring<br>to a bake sale (page 40), or&#x2014;uh&#x2014;the best French toast to serve to your boss at<br>that breakfast meeting (page 130), you&#x2019;re not usually concerned with the dish&#x2019;s<br>fat content. You just want people to take a bite, stagger with joy and beg you for<br>the recipe.<br>&nbsp;With these recipes, they will. I know, because it always happens to me.<br>A word about this book&#x2019;s organization. Unlike most cookbooks, it lists the<br>recipes in alphabetical order rather than by category. That&#x2019;s because I expect<br>people to use the book when they&#x2019;re hunting for a specific &#x201c;best,&#x201d; not idly<br>thumbing through the pages trying to decide what to make for dinner.<br>For the most part, I&#x2019;ve alphabetized the recipes by each dish&#x2019;s main quality.<br>On the other hand, fried chicken and roast chicken do share the same section.<br>Why is this? Because it makes more sense. Chicken is the main thing about both<br>recipes, not friedness or roastedness, just as salad is the main thing about green<br>salad, while potatoes are the main thing about potato salad.<br>&nbsp;If you can&#x2019;t bear to hunt down recipes in this way, you can always turn to<br>the index. Things are conventionally organized there. But I think it&#x2019;s more fun<br>to read a cookbook with all different kinds of recipes jostled together, just as I<br>prefer bookshelves where books like Betsy-Tacy and Tib are snuggled between&nbsp;<br>The Interpretation of Dreams and A Field Guide to Mammals of North America.</p> <p>Not-Controversial-at-All Apple Crisp, It Turns Out (formerly Very Controversial<br>Apple Crisp) Serves 4 to 6.</p> <p>The controversy, explained in my cookbook BEAT THAT!,<br>was that some people prefer this recipe to the one that appeared in<br>Beat This! Or so I thought. It turned out that everyone prefers this<br>recipe. My friend Denise made it for her husband, Peter, who took a<br>bite and said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no controversy.&#x201d; The novelist Elizabeth Berg wrote me<br>that she&#x2019;d looked for a fabulous apple crisp she wanted to send me, and then<br>realized that it was this recipe she wanted to send.<br>So: thanks to Marialisa Calta for setting me straight. She serves this with ice<br>cream, but I like heavy cream better. But that&#x2019;s just a small semantic diff erence.<br>I sometimes make this with 4 cups of pears and a big handful of dried cranberries.<br>Excellent!</p> <p>4 generous cups Golden Delicious apples, peeled, cored and sliced<br>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice<br>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon mixed with 1 teaspoon sugar<br>1 cup dark brown sugar, packed<br>. cup all-purpose fl our<br>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened<br>&#x215b; teaspoon salt<br>Vanilla ice cream, whipped cream or straight-up heavy cream</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 375�F, with a rack in the middle. Butter a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan.<br>&nbsp;In a large bowl, toss the apple slices with the lemon juice and cinnamon sugar.<br>In a small bowl, blend the brown sugar, fl our, butter and salt together'&#x2014;'fi rst<br>with a pastry blender or two knives, and then with your hands.<br>&nbsp;Put the apple slices into the loaf pan. Press the topping over them. Bake the<br>apple crisp for 1 hour. At that point, says Marialisa, &#x201c;You get this really dense,<br>chewy, unbelievable candylike topping.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Serve the apple crisp warm or cold with the ice cream or cream. It is also<br>very good when it&#x2019;s chilled for a couple of days; the topping melts down into the<br>apples a bit.</p> <p>Many-Splendored Guacamole<br>Makes 5 generous cups.</p> <p>The original BEAT THIS! had a good guacamole recipe,<br>but my friend Laura Lloyd later sent me one that was way better. &#x201c;I<br>was fully levitated when I tried it,&#x201d; she said.<br>This guac does have a billion ingredients, but they&#x2019;re mostly ones<br>you&#x2019;ll have in the house already. I&#x2019;ve taken out the original recipe&#x2019;s chorizo,<br>black olives and jicama.<br>You do remember that the avocado pit does nothing to keep guacamole from<br>turning brown, right? The thing that will help keep it green is nice, tight plastic<br>wrap over the top&#x2014;that, and the lemon juice.<br>Go thou and levitate!</p> <p>4 ripe avocados, preferably Hass<br>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br>2 scallions, chopped (include as much green as possible)<br>2 large garlic cloves, minced<br>2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced<br>1 medium tomato, deglopped and chopped<br>1 tablespoon sour cream<br>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce<br>1 tablespoon olive oil<br>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar<br>2 teaspoons ground cumin<br>2 teaspoons chili powder<br>. cup medium-hot salsa<br>. cup grated Monterey Jack<br>2 tablespoons tequila<br>2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro<br>1 teaspoon salt</p> <p>In a medium bowl, mash the avocados. Stir in the other ingredients in order.<br>Wrap the guacamole tightly in plastic wrap if you&#x2019;re not serving it right away,<br>but serve it the same day you make it.</p> <p>Mom-Style Meat Loaf<br>Serves 6.</p> <p>Whenever I make meat loaf, I remember the I LOVE<br>Lucy episode where Lucy loses her engagement ring. Ricky<br>says, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t cry, honey. I&#x2019;ll get you a new ring with big diamonds<br>all the way around,&#x201d; and Lucy sobs back, &#x201c;No!

Abandoned by the United States when it withdrew in 1975, the Hmong have been subjected to a campaign of genocide by communist Laos and Vietnam, including the use of chemical-biological toxin warfare. Thousands of Hmong, now scattered in refugee camps, are being forcibly repatriated to Laos - where they face retribution and terror. From their ancient homelands in China, with a fiercely independent culture dating back to 2000 B.C., the Hmong migrated southward out of China into the mountains of Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. More than 120,000 Hmong now live in the United States, from California to Minnesota to Pennsylvania. But thousands more lead desperate lives in refugee camps in Southeast Asia - knowing that repatriation could mean death. Tragic Mountains tells the story of the Hmong struggle for freedom and survival in Laos from 1942 to the present. During those years, most Hmong sided with the French against the Japanese and Ho Chi Minh&#39;s Viet Minh and then with the Americans against the North Vietnamese. These allegiances have led the current Lao government to declare the Hmong as enemies, vowing to &#34;&#34;wipe them out.&#34;&#34; This is a story of courage, tenacity, brutality, secrecy, incredible heroism by Hmong and Americans alike, international cynicism, betrayal, genocide, resilience, and (still) hope. Jane Hamilton-Merritt has written it to open the world&#39;s eyes to the proud history and current tragedy of the Hmong - with the desire that this book &#34;&#34;might yet change the destiny of those repatriated.&#34;&#34;</p><p><p>Jane Hamilton-Merritt was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1969 for her coverage of the Vietnam War, and in 1998 for the Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition of her long-standing efforts on behalf of the Hmong. Tragic Mountains is her account of the historic struggle of the Hmong and of their betrayal by the United States.</p>The Hmong, a mountain people of Laos, were U.S. allies during the Vietnam war. A noble, friendly folk with a 4000-year-old culture, they are the object of a genocidal campaign by the communist Laotian and Vietnamese governments. In this bitter, tragic and disturbing saga, Asian scholar/journalist/photographer Hamilton-Merritt documents the horrible suffering endured by the Hmong since they were abandoned by the U.S. in 1975. Her collection of eyewitness testimonies establishes that the Laotian-Vietnamese forces have field-tested chemical and biological toxins by using Hmong villages as targets (the "yellow rain" dismissed by the Western media as bee dung). The situation is especially urgent because those thousands of Hmong who succeeded in escaping to Thailand are now being forcibly repatriated to their homeland, where they face extermination as a despised minority and former "running dogs of the imperialist." Hamilton-Merritt's impressive study, one hopes, will lead to the belated U.S. recognition of responsibility for the plight of the Hmong.

Her own works of poetry include Heralding the Milk Light, Without Warning, and Hot Haiku. She is also the author of Chiyo-ni: Woman Haiku Master. She teaches at a university in Tokyo.Gr. 4-8. Although this looks like a picture book for young readers, it is actually a comprehensive introduction to haiku that poetry students of many ages can enjoy. Donegan, a poet who lives in Japan, begins by explaining basic concepts (what it means to "look though haiku eyes") before she goes on to describe the seven elements of traditional haiku. The remainder of the book offers haiku projects and exercises, accompanied by lengthy explanations, hints, and even word charts to help children create poems. The somewhat stilted color illustrations may put off older readers, and some exercises contain fill-in-the-blank sections, a format that's not ideal for library circulation. But Donegan presents a great deal of information clearly and with authority, and her enthusiasm for her subject is contagious, particularly when she describes what writing haiku encourages us to do: "see and appreciate the world around us more." A glossary and a haiku resource guide round out this excellent choice for children as well as teachers seeking fresh materials for poetry units. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A son of the working class who began as a machinist and toolmaker, Ovshinsky focused his work on finding solutions to urgent social problems, and to pursue those goals, he founded Energy Conversion Devices, a unique research and development lab. At the end of his life, battered by personal and professional losses, Ovshinsky nevertheless kept working to combat global warming by making solar energy &#x201c;cheaper than coal&#x201d;&#x2015;another of his many visions of a better tomorrow.</p></p><p>Lillian Hoddeson is Professor of History Emerita and Thomas Siebel Chair in the History of Science Emerita at the University of Illinois at Urbana&#x2013;Champaign. She is the coauthor of <i>True Genius: The Life and Science of John Bardeen</i> and other books.<p>Stan Ovshinsky really did see tomorrow. The batteries that power our cell phones and car batteries all owe a debt to him, as do our flat-screen TVs and the solar panels on our roofs, which are coated in the thin films he pioneered. But what I admired him for most was his firm belief that inequity of all sorts could be solved by science, that science breaks down boundaries, increases opportunities, and builds bridges between diverse people and communities. <i>The Man Who Saw Tomorrow</i> pays tribute to Stan's many achievements and honors the humanity of a man who believed that the machinists and toolers who turned his ideas into reality were just as important as the academics who flocked to his living room.</p>&#x2015;<b>Joi Ito</b>, Director, MIT Media Lab; coauthor of <i>Whiplash: How to Survive Our Faster Future</i><br><br><p>A fascinating read for people who love biography, this study of an adventurous life also offers penetrating insights into modern science, invention, and entrepreneurship.</p>&#x2015;<b>Spencer Weart</b>, Historian Emeritus, American Institute of Physics</p><h2>jQuery in Action</h2><p><p><b>Summary</b></p><p><i>jQuery in Action, Third Edition</i>, is a fast-paced and complete guide to jQuery, focused on the tasks you'll face in nearly any web dev project.

In clear, jargon-free language, Eleanor Heartney situates Postmodernism historically, showing how it developed both in reaction to and as a result of some of the fundamental beliefs underlying Modernism, especially its positivist, universalizing aspects. She then analyzes paradigmatic Postmodern works of art by artists such as Cindy Sherman, Sherrie Levine, Jeff Koons and Robert Mapplethorpe. Postmodernism provides a concise and articulate overview of the Postmodern phenomenon. Eleanor Heartney is a contributing editor for Art in America, New Art Examiner, and Art Press. In 1991, she was the recipient of the Frank Jewett Mather Award for Distinction in Art Criticism. Heartney is a board member of the American section of the AICA.

In this revised edition, exercises are integrated throughout the book. The result is a genuinely interactive introduction which engages the reader in developing the argument. Each chapter concludes with updated notes to guide further reading.</p><p>When is a reason for doing or believing something a good reason? Over the past century, logic's contribution to answering this question has typically involved finding ''logical forms": that is, using a special notation to bring out logical features more clearly. <p>The correct identification of logical forms has been held to be important not only to logic but also to philosophy. Bertrand Russell coined the phrase "philosophical logic" to describe an approach to philosophical problems: find the correct logical form of the problematic sentences, and the problems vanish. <i>Logical Forms</i> explains both the theoretical underpinnings of the approach and the detailed problems involved in finding logical forms in the languages of propositional logic, classical first order logic, modal logic, and some alternatives such as free logic, binary and substitutional quantifiers.</p> <p>This revised edition incorporates results of recent work. Chapter 3 on conditionals, and the sections dealing with predicate quantifiers, free logics and subjunctive conditionals have been completely rewritten. The exercises are integrated throughout the book, and each chapter concludes with updated notes to guide further reading. The result is a genuinely interactive introduction which engages the reader in developing the argument.</p> <p>This book does not presuppose knowledge of deductive methods in formal logic and it will be of immense benefit to those approaching philosophical logic for the first time.</p><b>Mark Sainsbury</b> is Susan Stebbing Professor of Philosophy at King's College London.

They maintained their will to alter their fate, survived subjugation, and quite often escaped to establish families in the American West.</p><p>Benson Tong is Assistant Professor of History, Wichita State University, and author of <i>Susan La Flesche Picotte, M.D.: Omaha Indian Leader and Reformer</i> also published by the University of Oklahoma Press.Tong (U.S. history, Univ. of Toledo) makes extensive use of primary sources and government documents to trace the tragic circumstances of Chinese prostitutes in San Francisco. His focus is the period 1849-82, which represents the first phase of Chinese involvement with the vice trade in California. Chinese men in search of economic relief came to the American West, leaving wives and families behind. The economic hardships of Chinese families at home and the loneliness of Chinese men in California created a thriving market in young Chinese women, most of whom were either indentured or sold by their families or simply kidnapped. This first book-length study of Chinese prostitutes in the American West is a valuable addition to history and women's study collections. Two related works on prostitution in the West are Anne M. Butler's Daughters of Joy, Sisters of Misery (LJ 3/1/85) and Jacqueline B. Barnhart's The Fair but Frail (Univ. of Nevada Pr., 1986).<br><i>Linda V.

Each of the volume's eight main sections comprises a brief explanatory introduction, four to six essays selected for their enduring significance, and suggestions for further reading. Topics addressed include problems of defining rhetoric, the relationship between rhetoric and epistemology, the rhetorical situation, reason and public morality, the nature of the audience, the role of discourse in social change, rhetoric in the mass media, and challenges to rhetorical theory from the margins. An extensive subject index facilitates comparison of key concepts and principles across all of the essays featured. <br></p><p>Lucaites, Condit, and Caudill have done an exceptional job of mapping out the terrain of issues facing contemporary rhetorical theorists.

He is also known for having written some of the most thoughtful, provocative, and influential essays of his generation. From "The Legacy of Jackson Pollock" in 1958 to "The Meaning of Life" in 1990, Kaprow has conducted a sustained philosophical inquiry into the paradoxical relationship of art to life, and thus into the nature of meaning itself. With the publication of this book, twenty-three of Kaprow's most significant essays are brought together in one volume for the first time.<br><br>Kaprow charts his own evolution as an artist and also comments on contemporaneous developments in the arts. From the modernist avant-garde of the fifties to the current postmodern <i>fin de si�cle</i>, Kaprow has written about&#x2014;and from within&#x2014;the shifting, blurring boundaries of genre, media, culture, and experience. Edited and introduced by critic Jeff Kelley, these essays bring into crisp focus the thinking of one of the most influential figures in the varied landscape of American art since the late 1950s.</p><p>"Kaprow has shown how certain ordinary experiences and events, if properly conceptualized and performed consciously, could be 'art' and how art if properly contexted could be experienced as co-existent with 'life'. His writings not only explain but inspire; they are theoretical in the deepest sense of making one <i>see</i> and <i>experience</i> thought."&#x2014;Richard Schechner, University Professor, New York University<br><br>"Kaprow's writings are one of the most important bodies of work documenting the feeling, at the end of the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, that art itself had reached an impasse and become so formalized that it had evolved into a rarefied, elitist mode of cultural hegemony, and in order to make meaningful art one needed, somehow, to sidestep the art world altogether."&#x2014;Henry Sayre, Oregon State University&#34;Allan Kaprow&#39;s essays sound fresh and new. . . . Artists of the world, read this--you have nothing to lose but your equilibrium.&#34;--Lucy R. Lippard, author of &#34;Mixed Blessings: New Art in a Multicultural America</p><h2>Bricks and Brownstone</h2><p>Bricks and Brownstone is the first book to examine the architectural styles of the venerable New York row house, the way of life of the families who lived in these unique houses, and the outstanding neighborhoods of a rapidly growing and changing city. The result is a charming and nostalgic evocation of bygone days in a town house or &#34;brownstone&#34; in nineteenth-century America&#39;s richest, most powerful, and most cosmopolitan city. With the aid of handsome photographs and engravings (over half of them 100 years old) the author presents the history of the various row house architectural styles--the Federal, Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate, and Second Empire, as well as eclectic but picturesque styles of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Mr. Lockwood also discusses and illustrates the features of the several styles--among them doorways, iron work, mantels, and ceiling ornaments--which the architect and brownstone owner will find invaluable in restoring a row house to its original appearance. The old photographs of long-vanished houses and Street scenes in New York are a special treat for the reader. Bricks and Brownstone is an important contribution to New York&#39;s &#34;brownstone revival,&#34; part of a nationwide phenomenon that has rescued thousands of architecturally and historically distinguished--but run-down--inner-city houses and entire neighborhoods for the habitation and delight of future generations.</p><p></p><h2>Berlin Tales (City Tales)</h2><p>If there is one city that captures the tragedy and euphoria of the twentieth century, it is Berlin. The scene of socialist revolution and Nazi oppression, invaded and occupied, divided and blockaded, it rose again after German reunification to become a thriving global cultural center. Not surprisingly, Berlin has been home to some of the finest writers in any language, who have rooted their tales in the nooks and neighborhoods of this fascinating place. In Berlin Tales, translator Lyn Marven and editor Helen Constantine offer a collection that reveals the literary brilliance and urban richness found in Berlin over the decades. The stories are grouped together by district-from the Jewish Mitte to Turkish Kreuzberg, from Alexanderplatz to individual streets-and layered on top of each other historically, providing a narrative palimpsest that tells us much about the city and its writers. The city&#39;s image, meaning, and appeal to immigrants and tourists find full expression here, in this remarkable array of work from across the decades.</p><p><br><strong>Helen Constantine</strong> is editor of the magazine <em>Modern Poetry in Translation.</em><br><strong></strong> Lyn Marven is a lecturer in German at the University of Liverpool.<br><br>"Poignant, and highly reccommended." --<em>Midwest Book Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Life and Terror in Stalin&#39;s Russia, 1934-1941</h2><p>Terror, in the sense of mass, unjust arrests, characterized the USSR during the late 1930s. But, argues Robert Thurston in this controversial book, Stalin did not intend to terrorize the country and did not need to rule by fear. Memoirs and interviews with Soviet people indicate that many more believed in Stalin's quest to eliminate internal enemies than were frightened by it. <br><br>Drawing on recently opened Soviet archives and other sources, Thurston shows that between 1934 and 1936 police and court practice relaxed significantly. Then a series of events, together with the tense international situation and memories of real enemy activity during the savage Russian Civil War, combined to push leaders and people into a hysterical hunt for perceived "wreckers." After late 1938, however, the police and courts became dramatically milder.<br><br>Coercion was not the key factor keeping the regime in power. More important was voluntary support, fostered at least in the cities by broad opportunities to criticize conditions and participate in decision making on the local level. The German invasion of 1941 found the populace deeply divided in its judgment of Stalinism, but the country's soldiers generally fought hard in its defense. Using German and Russian sources, the author probes Soviet morale and performance in the early fighting.<br><br>Thurston's portrait of the era sheds new light on Stalin and the nature of his regime. It presents an unconventional and less condescending view of the Soviet people, depicted not simply as victims but also as actors in the violence, criticisms, and local decisions of the 1930s. Ironically, Stalinism helped prepare the way for the much more active society and for the reforms of fifty years later.<br></p><p>Terror, in the sense of mass, unjust arrests, characterized the USSR during the late 1930s.

This study surveys the history of the social movement, puts forward a theory of collective action to explain its surges and declines, and offers an interpretation of the power of movement that emphasizes its effects on personal lives, policy reforms and political culture. While covering cultural, organizational and personal sources of movements&#39; power, the book emphasizes the rise and fall of social movements as part of political struggle and as the outcome of changes in political opportunity structure. This second edition has an entirely new chapter, major additions to the bibliography, new illustrative materials in many of the chapters and a new conclusion.</p><p>The book is suitable for both specialized readers in sociology, political sicence, and modern (Europeans and American) history as well as for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on social movements. It is written clearly and simply, but not as an introductory text. Graphic and tabular material is limited and most of the technical or documentary material is relegated to extensive notes. There is a large bibliography drawing from modern history, political science and sociological studies of social movements and collective action.Sidney Tarrow is Maxwell M.

Mocked for his childlike naivety yet valued for his openness and understanding, Prince Myshkin finds himself entangled with two women in a position he cannot bring himself to resolve.

As usual, everyone was tired, everyone&#x2019;s eyes had grown heavy in the night, everyone was chilled, all the faces were pale and yellow, matching the color of the fog.<br><br>In one of the third-class carriages, right by the window, two passengers had, from early dawn, been sitting facing one another&#x2014;both were young people, both traveled light, both were unfashionably dressed, both had rather remarkable faces, and both expressed, at last, a desire to start a conversation. If they had both known, one about the other, in what way they were especially remarkable in that moment, they would naturally have wondered that chance had so strangely placed them face to face in a third-class carriage of the Warsaw&#x2013;Petersburg train. One of them was a short man about twenty-seven, with almost black curly hair and small but fiery gray eyes. His nose was broad and flat, his cheekbones high; his thin lips continually curved into a sort of insolent, mocking and even malicious smile; but the high and well-shaped forehead redeemed the ignoble lines of the lower part of the face. What was particularly striking about the young man&#x2019;s face was its deathly pallor, which lent him an exhausted look in spite of his fairly sturdy build, and at the same time something passionate to the point of suffering, which did not harmonize with his insolent and coarse smile and his sharp and self-satisfied gaze. He was warmly dressed in a full, black, sheepskin-lined overcoat, and had not felt the cold at night, while his neighbor had been forced to endure all the pleasures of a damp Russian November night, for which he was evidently unprepared. He had a fairly thick and wide cloak with no sleeves and a huge hood, just like those frequently used by travelers in winter somewhere far abroad, in Switzerland or, for instance, Northern Italy, who do not reckon, of course, on such distances along the journey as from Eydtkuhnen1 to Petersburg. But what was entirely suitable and satisfactory in Italy turned out to be not quite fitting for Russia. The owner of the hooded cloak was a young man, also twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, somewhat above the average in height, with very fair thick hair, with sunken cheeks and a thin, pointed, almost white beard. His eyes were large, blue and intent; there was something calm, though somber, in their expression, something full of that strange look by which some can surmise epilepsy in a person at first glance. The young man&#x2019;s face was otherwise pleasing, delicate and lean, though colorless, and at this moment even blue with cold. From his hands dangled a meager bundle tied up in an old, faded raw-silk kerchief, which, it seemed, contained the entirety of his traveling effects. He wore thick-soled boots and spats&#x2014;it was all very un-Russian. His dark-haired neighbor in the sheepskin observed all this, partly from having nothing to do, and at last, with that indelicate smile in which satisfaction at the misfortunes of others is sometimes so unceremoniously and casually expressed, he asked:<br><br>&#x201c;Chilly?&#x201d;<br><br>And he shuddered.<br><br>&#x201c;Very,&#x201d; answered his neighbor, with extraordinary readiness, &#x201c;and just think, it&#x2019;s thawing, too. What if there were a frost? I didn&#x2019;t even think it would be so cold at home. I&#x2019;ve become unused to it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;From abroad, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, from Switzerland.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Phew! You don&#x2019;t say!&#x201d; The dark-haired man whistled and burst into laughter.<br><br>They struck up a conversation. The readiness of the fair young man in the Swiss cloak to answer all his swarthy companion&#x2019;s inquiries was astonishing and without the merest suspicion of the absolute thoughtlessness, inappropriateness and idleness of some of the questions. In answering, he declared by the by that he had indeed not been in Russia for a long time, a little over four years, that he had been sent abroad on account of an illness, some kind of strange nervous illness, like epilepsy or St. Vitus&#x2019;s dance, resulting in trembling fits and convulsions. The swarthy man chuckled several times as he listened; and he laughed particularly when, in answer to his inquiry, &#x201c;Well, have they cured you?&#x201d; the fair one answered, &#x201c;No, they haven&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ha! You must have wasted a lot of money over it, and we believe in them over here,&#x201d; the swarthy man observed sarcastically.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the honest truth!&#x201d; interposed a badly dressed gentleman sitting beside them, a petty official type, set in his crusty scrivener&#x2019;s ways, about forty, powerfully built, with a red nose and pimpled face&#x2014;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the honest truth, sir, they only absorb all the resources of Russia for nothing!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you are quite mistaken in my case!&#x201d; the patient from Switzerland chimed in with a gentle and conciliatory voice. &#x201c;Of course, I can&#x2019;t argue with you because I don&#x2019;t know all about it, but my doctor even shared his last penny with me for the journey here; and there, he supported me at his expense for nearly two years.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why, had you no one to pay for you?&#x201d; asked the swarthy man.<br><br>&#x201c;No; Mr. Pavlishchev, who used to pay for me there, died two years ago. I&#x2019;ve since written to Generaless Epanchin, a distant relation of mine, but I&#x2019;ve had no answer. So I&#x2019;ve come . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where are you going then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You mean, where am I going to stay? . . . I don&#x2019;t rightly know yet . . . Somewhere . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve not made up your mind yet?&#x201d; And both his listeners burst out laughing again.<br><br>&#x201c;And no doubt that bundle is all you&#x2019;ve got in the world?&#x201d; asked the swarthy man.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m willing to bet on it,&#x201d; chimed in the red-nosed official with an exceptionally gleeful air, &#x201c;and that he&#x2019;s got nothing else in the luggage van, though poverty is no vice, which, again, one mustn&#x2019;t neglect to note.&#x201d;<br><br>It turned out that this was the case, too; the fair-haired young man acknowledged it at once with extraordinary readiness.<br><br>&#x201c;Your bundle has some value, anyway,&#x201d; the petty official went on, when they had laughed to their heart&#x2019;s content (remarkably, the owner of the bundle finally began to laugh himself, looking at them, which increased their mirth), &#x201c;and though you could stake your head that it contains no golden rolls of foreign coin with Napoleons or Friedrichs, to say nothing of Dutch Arapchicks, which may already be concluded merely from the spats covering those foreign boots of yours, yet . . . when we add to your bundle such a purported relation as, for ex- ample, Generaless Epanchin, then even the bundle takes on a certain different significance, needless to say, but only in the case that Generaless Epanchin is really your relation and you are not mistaken, out of absentmindedness . . . which a person is very, very wont to do, if only . . . from an excess of imagination.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, you&#x2019;ve guessed right again,&#x201d; the fair young man chimed in. &#x201c;It really is almost a mistake, that&#x2019;s to say, she is almost no relation; so much so that I really was not at all surprised back then, when I got no answer there. It was what I expected.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You simply wasted the money for the postage. Hm! . . . Anyway, you are open-hearted and sincere, which is commendable. Hm! . . . As for General Epanchin, we know him, yes sir, for, actually, he is a man everyone knows; and I used to know the late Mr. Pavlishchev, too, who paid your expenses in Switzerland, that is if it was Nikolai Andreevich Pavlishchev, for there were two of them, cousins. The other lives in the Crimea. The late Nikolai Andreevich was a worthy man and well connected, and he&#x2019;d four thousand serfs in his day . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just so, Nikolai Andreevich Pavlishchev was his name.&#x201d;<br><br>And having answered, the young man intently and searchingly scrutinized the know-it-all gentleman. One encounters these know-it-all gentlemen sometimes, even fairly often, in a certain well-known social sphere. They know everything. All the restless curiosity and faculties of their mind are irresistibly bent in one direction, no doubt from lack of more important ideas and interests in life, as the contemporary thinker would put it. The phrase &#x201c;they know everything,&#x201d; by the way, must be taken to apply to a rather limited sphere: where so-and- so serves, with whom he is acquainted, the amount of his net worth, where he was governor, to whom he&#x2019;s married, how much his wife brought in, who are his cousins, who twice removed, etc., etc., and so on in that vein. For the most part, these know-it-alls walk about with worn-out elbows and receive a salary of seventeen rubles a month. The people of whose lives they know every last detail would be at a loss to imagine their motives. Yet, in the meantime many of them are positively consoled by this knowledge, which amounts to a complete science, and derive from it self-respect and even their highest spiritual gratification. And indeed it is a fascinating science. I have seen learned men, literary men, poets, politicians, who sought and found in that very science their greatest worldly comforts and goals, indeed, positively making their careers solely on that account. Throughout this entire conversation the swarthy young man had been yawning, looking aimlessly out of the window and impatiently expecting the end of the journey. He was somehow preoccupied, extremely preoccupied, almost agitated; he was even becoming somewhat strange: at times he would both hear and not hear, look and not look, laugh and not know or understand what he was laughing at.<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me, whom have I the honor . . .&#x201d; the pimply gentleman said suddenly, addressing the fair young man with the bundle.<br><br>&#x201c;Prince Lev Nikolaevich Myshkin,&#x201d; replied the latter with prompt and unhesitating readiness.<br><br>&#x201c;Prince Myshkin? Lev Nikolaevich? Don&#x2019;t know . . . Can&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;ve ever heard . . .&#x201d; the official responded thoughtfully. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean the<br><br>name, that is, it&#x2019;s a historical name, it&#x2019;s to be found in Karamzin&#x2019;s History, as it should be; I mean you personally, and indeed there are no<br><br>Prince Myshkins to be met with anywhere, one never hears of them anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I should think not,&#x201d; the prince answered at once, &#x201c;there are no Prince Myshkins now except me; I believe I am the last of them. And as for our fathers and grandfathers, some of them had even been odnodvortsy. My father, by the way, was a sublieutenant in the army, of the Junkers. But I don&#x2019;t in fact know how Generaless Epanchin also wound up being of the Myshkins, also the last in her line . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He-he-he! The last in her line! He-he! What a phrase you turn,&#x201d; giggled the official.<br><br>The swarthy man smirked, too. The fair man was rather surprised that he had managed to make a pun, and a pretty bad one at that.<br><br>&#x201c;Imagine, I said it without thinking,&#x201d; he explained at last, wondering.<br><br>&#x201c;To be sure, to be sure you did,&#x201d; the official assented good-humoredly.<br><br>&#x201c;So then, Prince, and you&#x2019;ve been studying the sciences out there too, with the professor, have you?&#x201d; asked the swarthy man suddenly.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes . . . I was studying.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For my part, I&#x2019;ve never studied anything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I only did a little, you know,&#x201d; added the prince almost apologetically. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t possible to teach me systematically, because of my illness.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know the Rogozhins?&#x201d; the swarthy man asked quickly.<br><br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t know them at all. I know very few people in Russia. You&#x2019;re a Rogozhin, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, my name is Rogozhin, Parfyon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Parfyon? That wouldn&#x2019;t be of those same Rogozhins . . .&#x201d; the official began, with increased gravity.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, one of those, one of the same,&#x201d; interrupted the swarthy man quickly and with uncivil impatience. And indeed, he hadn&#x2019;t addressed the pimply official even once, but from the very start had spoken only to the prince.<br><br>&#x201c;But . . . how is that?&#x201d; The official froze with amazement and his eyes nearly popped out of his head, his whole face immediately beginning to assume a reverent and servile, almost frightened, expression. &#x201c;Related to the same Semyon Parfyonovich Rogozhin, Hereditary Honorable Citizen, what passed on a month since and left two and a half million in capital?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And how do you know he left a clear two and a half million?&#x201d; the swarthy man interrupted, not deigning to glance toward the official now, either. &#x201c;Just look! (he indicated him to the prince with a wink), and what do they possibly gain by sucking up to you at once? But it&#x2019;s true that my father has died, and as for me, a month later, I&#x2019;m going home from Pskov practically barefoot. Neither my brother, that scoundrel, nor my mother have sent either money or word&#x2014;I was sent nothing! Like a dog! I&#x2019;ve spent the entire month lying in a fever in Pskov! . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And now you are coming in for a tidy million, at the lowest reckoning, oh Lord!&#x201d; the official flung up his hands.<br><br>&#x201c;What is it to him, tell me that?&#x201d; said Rogozhin, nodding irritably and angrily toward him again. &#x201c;Why, I am not going to give you a farthing of it, though you may walk on your hands before me, if you like.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will, I will.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You see! But I won&#x2019;t give you anything, I won&#x2019;t, if you dance for a whole week.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, don&#x2019;t! And I don&#x2019;t need it. Don&#x2019;t! But I shall dance. I shall leave my wife and children and dance before you. Only to flatter! To flatter!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fie on you!&#x201d; spat the swarthy man. &#x201c;Five weeks ago, like you&#x201d;&#x2014;he addressed the prince&#x2014;&#x201c;with nothing but a bundle, I ran away from my father to Pskov, to my aunt; and there collapsed with fever, while he went and died without me. Kicked the bucket. Eternal memory to the deceased, but he almost killed me then! Would you believe it, Prince, yes, by God! Had I not run away then, he would have killed me on the spot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you do something to make him angry?&#x201d; countered the prince, examining the millionaire in the sheepskin with some particular interest. But though there may have been something intrinsically remarkable in the million and in receiving a legacy, the prince was surprised and interested by something else as well; and Rogozhin himself was for some reason especially keen to converse with the prince, though it seemed he was in need of conversation in a more mechanical than spiritual sense; rather more from preoccupation than frankness; from agitation and disquiet, for the sake of just looking at someone and prattling on about something. It seemed that he was still in a feverish state, and at the very least suffering from the chills. As for the official, well, he simply hovered over Rogozhin, didn&#x2019;t dare to breathe, hung on every word and weighed it, precisely as if looking for a diamond.<br><br>&#x201c;Angry he certainly was, and perhaps with reason,&#x201d; answered Rogozhin, &#x201c;but more than anything, my brother did me in. Nothing can be said against my mother, she&#x2019;s an old woman, reads the Lives of the Saints, sits with the crones, and whatever brother Senjka9 resolves, so it shall be done. And why didn&#x2019;t he send word to me at the time, then? It&#x2019;s clear, sir! It&#x2019;s true I was unconscious at the time. They say a telegram was sent, too. But you just see if a telegram can get to my aunt. She&#x2019;s widowed going on thirty years now and keeps sitting with the holy fools from morning till night. A nun she isn&#x2019;t, but even worse. Well, the telegram gave her a fright, and without opening it, she went and presented it at the constable&#x2019;s station, where it still lies to this day. Only Konyov, Vassily Vassilielich, came to my r...</p><h2>The Illustrated History of Canada</h2><p><p> <b>The Illustrated History of Canada</b> is the only comprehensive, authoritative one-volume history of the nation.

With a special focus on black and white photography, the book also explores digital techniques and web photography resources, equipment, cameras and camera accessories, the exposure and development of film, and the making and finishing of prints. All aspects of the process are explained and illustrated clearly in two-page spreads, each of which addresses a self-contained topic. </p></p><p><p> If you don't know anything about photography and would like to learn, or if you want to make better pictures than the ones you make now, A Short Course in Photography will help you. It presents in depth the basic techniques for black-and-white photography: </p><p> <br>* How to get a good exposure <br>* How to adjust the focus, shutter speed, and aperture (the size of the lens opening) to produce the results you want <br>* How to develop film and make prints <br> </p><p> Most of today's cameras incorporate automatic features, but that doesn't mean that they automatically produce the results you want. A Short Course in Photography devotes special attention to: </p><p> <br>* Automatic focus and automatic exposure&#x2014;what they do and, particularly, how to override them when it is better to adjust the camera manually <br> </p><p> Some of the book's highlights include: </p><p> <br>* Getting Started. If you are brand new to photography, this section will walk you through the first steps of selecting and loading film, focusing sharply, adjusting the exposure, and making your first pictures. See pages 4-9. <br>* Digital Imaging. In one sense, digital imaging is just another tool, but it is also an immensely powerful technique that is changing photography and that will empower those who know how to use it. See pages 152-157. <br>* Projects. These projects are designed to help you develop your technical and expressive skills. See, for example, page 128 or 173. <br>* Making Better Prints. Additional information about how to fine tune your prints by burning in and dodging (darkening or lightening selected areas), and by cropping the edges to concentrate attention on the portion of the scene you want. See pages 114-117. <br>* Types of lenses, types of film, lighting, filters <br> </p><p> Photography is a subjective and personal undertaking. A Short Course in Photography emphasizes your choices in picture making: </p><p> <br>* How to look at a scene in terms of the way the camera can record it <br>* How to select the shutter speed, point of view, or other elements that can make the difference between an ordinary snapshot and an exciting photograph <br>* Chapter 9, Seeing Like a Camera, explores your choices in selecting and adjusting the image, and covers how to photograph subjects such as people and landscapes <br> New to this edition are </p><p> <br>* Using a Digital Camera. How to make photographs digitally from start to finish <br>* Up-to-date information on Health and Safety precautions in the darkroom <br>* Technical updates throughout <br>* Many new photographs and illustrations <br> </p><p> This book is designed to make learning photography as easy as possible: </p><p> <br>* Every two facing pages completes a single topic <br>* Detailed step-by-step instructions clarify each stage of extended procedures such as negative development and printing <br>* Boldfaced headings make subtopics easy to spot <br>* Numerous photographs and drawings illustrate each topic <br> Acknowledgments </p><p> Many people gave generously of their time and effort in the production of this book.

This thoroughly revised edition brings a decade of additional research to the same task. In addition to updating each chapter, the second edition features new chapters on the effectiveness of the alliance with children and adolescents, the alliance in couples and family therapy, real-time feedback from clients, patient preferences, culture, and attachment style. <br><br>The new editon provides "two books in one"--one on evidence-based relationship elements and one on evidence-based methods of adapting treatment to the individual patient. Each chapter features a specific therapist behavior that improves treatment outcome, or a transdiagnostic patient characteristic (such as reactance, preferences, culture, stage of change) by which clinicians can effectively tailor psychotherapy. All chapters provide original, comprehensive meta-analyses of the relevant research; clinical examples, and research-supported therapeutic practices by distinguished contributors. The result is a compelling synthesis of the best available research, clinical expertise, and patient characteristics in the tradition of evidence-based practice. <br><br>The second edition of<em> Psychotherapy Relationships That Work: Evidence-Based Responsiveness</em> proves indispensible for any mental health professional.<br><br>Reviews of the First Edition:<br><br>"A veritable gold mine of research related to relationships, this is a volume that should be an invaluable reference for every student and practitioner of psychotherapy."--<em>Psychotherapy</em><br> <br>"This is a MUST READ for any researcher, clinician, or counselor who is genuinely interested in the active ingredients of effective psychotherapy and who appreciates the importance of applying empirical evidence to the therapy relationship."--Arnold A.

Despite his influence on the early modern period, his correspondence, manuscripts, and publications in natural philosophy remain scattered throughout many disparate editions. In this volume, Newton&#39;s principal philosophical writings, including excerpts from the Principia and the Opticks and a corrected translation of &#39;De Gravitatione&#39;, are collected in a single place. This newly expanded second edition of Philosophical Writings contains new excerpts from Newton&#39;s earliest optical writings, some of his unpublished reflections on the interpretation of Scriptural passages that concern the Earth&#39;s motion, and his correspondence with important figures in his day, including the theologian Richard Bentley, the mathematician Roger Cotes, and the philosopher G. W. Leibniz. The excerpts show in depth how Newton developed a number of highly controversial views concerning space, time, motion and matter and then defended them against the withering criticisms of his contemporaries.</p><p>This newly expanded second edition contains excerpts from Newton&#39;s earliest optical writings, some of his unpublished reflections on the interpretation of Scriptural passages, and his correspondence with important figures in his day.

Having just been dismissed from the celebrated Miles Davis Quintet, he set out on the road, playing with his first touring group as a leader until he eventually formed what would become a revolutionary band. Taking the Swahili name <i>Mwandishi</i>, the group would go on to play some of the most innovative music of the 1970s, fusing an assortment of musical genres, American and African cultures, and acoustic and electronic sounds into groundbreaking experiments that helped shape the American popular music that followed. In <i>You&#x2019;ll Know When You Get There</i>, Bob Gluck offers the first comprehensive study of this influential group, mapping the musical, technological, political, and cultural changes that they not only lived in but also effected. &nbsp;</p> &nbsp; Beginning with Hancock&#x2019;s formative years as a sideman in bebop and hard bop ensembles, his work with Miles Davis, and the early recordings under his own name, Gluck uncovers the many ingredients that would come to form the Mwandishi sound. He offers an extensive series of interviews with Hancock and other band members, the producer and engineer who worked with them, and a catalog of well-known musicians who were profoundly influenced by the group. Paying close attention to the Mwandishi band&#x2019;s repertoire, he analyzes a wide array of recordings&#x2015;many little known&#x2015;and examines the group&#x2019;s instrumentation, their pioneering use of electronics, and their transformation of the studio into a compositional tool. &nbsp; From protofunk rhythms to synthesizers to the reclamation of African identities, Gluck tells the story of a highly peculiar and thrillingly unpredictable band that became a hallmark of American genius.<p> &nbsp;</p><br></p><p><b>Bob Gluck</b> is professor of music, a jazz historian, and director of the Electronic Music Studio at the State University of New York, Albany.&nbsp;&#x201c;In the forty years that have passed since I saw the Mwandishi band in Kansas City as a teenager, I have heard and even been able to participate in a lot of great music. But nothing I have experienced since has had more of an effect on my life than what those guys brought to the bandstand on those KC nights. To me, that band was the epitome of everything that jazz has ever promised to be. Collectively and individually, they brought together a sound that was so deeply in and of that moment in time that it became thus transcendent and timeless. They inspired me and a generation to aspire to their level of creativity and commitment. Herbie has always been one of my major heroes and still is. He has been great every step of the way from the beginning, but there was something really special with this band and the way it intersected with the culture that was unique and important. This book takes an in depth look at every detail of what made that amazing collection of musicians what it was. With his exhaustive research and detailed interviews, Bob Gluck brings the nature and workings of this amazing and influential ensemble to life.&#x201d; (Pat Metheny)<br><br>&#x201c;In <i>You&#x2019;ll Know When You Get There</i>, Bob Gluck takes a fascinating look at the development of a musical identity. The book is ostensibly about pianist Herbie Hancock and his sextet&#x2019;s Mwandishi period&#x2014;a free-jazz, electronics-heavy evolution of the hard-bop group he formed in 1968&#x2014;but it really uses Hancock&#x2019;s story to show how musicians adapt to changing technology, new musical ideas and greater cultural identities. At its core, the book is a study about how an artist accumulates a sound and the experiences that shape his musical views.....Perhaps, with this excellent primer, more listeners will start to unearth the joys found in Mwandishi&#x2019;s three recordings.&#x201d; (Jon Ross <i>DownBeat</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Gluck gives a keen sense of Hancock&#x2019;s wide-ranging curiosity and eager assimilation of influences, embracing diverse African and Asian musics, the <i>Klangfarbenmelodie </i>of the European avant-garde. . . . and contemporary directions in funk and pop. We get insights into Hancock&#x2019;s successful attempts to forge a new musical language, as well as his involvement in post-production and his delight in gadgetry. . . . There is a vast amount of information in <i>You'll Know When You Get There</i>, including interviews with and brief biographies of the band members. While they stress the collective dynamic of the group&#x2014; &#x2018;we were a family&#x2019;&#x2014;their individual achievements read like a who&#x2019;s who of hard- and post-bop jazz. There are also tributes and reminiscences from eminent successors such as Bobby McFerrin and Pat Metheny. We are given clear explanations of the converging styles and forms and the band&#x2019;s open but disciplined approach to improvisation. . . . The influence of the Mwandishi Band persists to the present day, beyond jazz, and this book does a good job in explaining how and why.&#x201d;&nbsp; (Lou Glandfeld <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps the most enigmatic ensemble to emerge from the Davis school was Herbie Hancock&#x2019;s Mwandishi Band, which today has acquired an almost legendary status. If pressed, most fans of music from this era would cite this ensemble as their favourite of the period&#x2014;indeed for some it is their favourite jazz ensemble of all time. So how did this band acquire its almost mythical status? It&#x2019;s a question that no-one has quite been able to put their finger on until Bob Gluck&#x2019;s exhaustive study, which offers valuable insight into the life and times of this band, with a wide range of interviews from the musicians themselves and those in the business&#x2014;record company producers, execs, promoters and the like. . . . In detail and breadth this is an impressive volume and is valuable for the insight it offers into the music making process, the artistic milieu of the period, and aesthetic aspirations behind the project.&#x201d; (Stuart Nicholson <i>Jazzwise</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Gluck&#x2019;s rich tapestry of musicians&#x2019; voices and concise, descriptive analyses allows for a reassessment of a period often over-looked in jazz scholarship.&#x201d;<br> (Kevin Fellezs <i>Jazz Studies</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Gluck has just enough actual experience and theoretical smarts to travel down the multidirectional vectors of the sonic experiments conducted by Herbie and his group and report back the totality of his findings. . . . Some of the most compelling sections of <i>You&#x2019;ll Know When You Get There</i> are those which reveal how the group&#x2019;s kinetic trajectory as an Afrodelic electroacoustic improvising unit was fully technologised and turbo-boosted in the crucible of the mix. . . . Gluck&#x2019;s interviewees attest to how advanced all this was for the time. In terms of process, groups such as Can or those led by Miles Davis were monolithic jam bands whose records had to be assembled into alien artefacts in the editing suite. On stage, The [Herbie Hancock] Sextet was already a shapeshifting time machine, moving from zero gravity tonal abstraction to quantum funk via dynamic thematic material and on-the-fly programming and processing, and the records documented electric real-time performances being expanded via the alchemical science of the console room. It was, as trombonist Pepo Mtoto Julian Priester states, &#x2018;a whole that was unified.&#x2019;&#x201d; (Tony Herrington <i>The Wire</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The music, rather than the personalities or life stories of the musicians, is this book&#x2019;s raison d&#x2019;etre. Musicians will find transcriptions of value, while non-musicians will not be overwhelmed by the notations and technical descriptions. Gluck goes to great length to describe the music meaningfully to the broader audience, always striving to encapsulate the special qualities of this body of work. . . . As well-known as Hancock is, this book serves as a valuable resource to understanding his progress, and leaves one hoping for official releases of many of the unissued concert recordings discussed here.&#x201d; (Martin Z. Kasdan Jr. <i>Louisville Courier-Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;An accomplished keyboardist and electronic synthesist himself, Gluck provides a wealth of&nbsp;insight into Hancock&#x2019;s music.&#x201d;&nbsp; (Tom Greenland <i>New York City Jazz Record</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Time has revealed Herbie Hancock's Mwandishi band to be one of the most exceptional and successful achievements of both a transformative musical era and Hancock's own long and varied career. A triumph of &#x2018;fusion&#x2019; in the most comprehensive sense of the term, Mwandishi merged the acoustic and electric, the exploratory and fundamental, and the musical and social in a manner that has rarely been duplicated. Bob Gluck does an inspired job in helping us to hear, and understand, every step of Mwandishi&#x2019;s process.&#x201d; (Bob Blumenthal, author and music critic)<br><br>&#x201c;Bob Gluck deserves much credit for choosing to write a book on, quite possibly, the most futuristic band of the last half-century. The music of Herbie Hancock&#x2019;s &#x2018;Mwandishi&#x2019; period still stands, over 40 years later, as some of the most advanced and fearless music of all-time.&#x201d; (Christian McBride)</p><h2>Pragmatism and Feminism: Reweaving the Social Fabric</h2><p><p>Though many pioneering feminists were deeply influenced by American pragmatism, their contemporary followers have generally ignored that tradition because of its marginalization by a philosophical mainstream intent on neutral analyses devoid of subjectivity.

Of those 5%, more than half must also cope with one or more comorbid disorders of learning, emotion, and behavior--complicating ADHD diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>The challenge for clinicians is to treat not just ADHD, but also the psychiatric disorders and comorbid disorders that often accompany it. Edited by a leading researcher and practitioner, <i>Attention-Deficit Disorders and Comorbidities in Children, Adolescents, and Adults</i> brings together the work of 25 distinguished contributors--all on the cutting edge of ADHD research.</p><p>The past decade of research and clinical experience has shown that ADHD is far from the simple disorder, starting in childhood and remitting in adulthood, it was once thought to be. Divided into two main sections, this volume includes a chapter on each of the psychiatric disorders and comorbidities that often occur with ADHD. </p><ul>? In the first section, "ADDs With Comorbidities," the editor introduces readers to ADHD by talking about our emerging understanding of and the latest genetic research on ADHD. The author of each subsequent chapter shows how ADHD interacts with mood and anxiety disorders, oppositionality and aggression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, learning disorders, substance abuse disorders, sleep disturbances, Tourette syndrome, and developmental coordination disorder.<p>This section concludes with two final chapters: one on assessing and treating ADDs in preschoolers and the other on different treatment outcomes as reported in existing longitudinal studies of ADDs.</p><p>? The second section, "Assessments and Interventions for ADDs", includes in-depth chapters on clinical assessment and diagnosis, pharmacotherapy, psychosocial and educational interventions, and a cognitive therapy perspective on ADHD.</p><p>This section wraps up by emphasizing the importance of tailoring treatment to the individual as a whole, considering not only comorbidities but also family and social settings. </p></ul><p>Heavily annotated and written with practical implications for both clinicians and educators in mind, this comprehensive volume demonstrates a scope and depth unparalleled within the current literature. As such, it will find its way into the libraries of professionals and interested laypersons alike: clinical psychiatrists and psychologists; pediatricians, family practitioners and other primary care physicians who treat children, adolescents, and adults; education professionals, including school nurses, special education teachers and administrators, and college and university disability services personnel; and juvenile justice system professionals, including clinical and social workers and administrators.</p></p><p>This 736 page book demonstrates a scope and depth unparalleled within the current literature on ADHD. It covers all age ranges across the lifespan and includes many references so that readers can readily access more detailed information on areas of specific interest. Written with a solid base of current research, it addresses concerns and practical needs of clinicians, educators, students and researchers in many professional fields including clinical psychologists and psychiatrists, pediatricians, family practitioners and other physicians and nurses who treat children, adolescents or adults; educational professionals including teachers, guidance counselors, special education teachers, school psychologists, administrators, and college and university disability services personnel; clinical social workers and marriage and family counselors, substance abuse counselors and juvenile justice system professionals,and others who work in various aspects of human services for children, adolescents or adults.This book is quite different from most existing books on ADHD. It includes clear explanation of a new model for understanding ADHD as a complex set of impairments in management functions of the mind. It begins with recognition that more than 50% of those affected by ADHD, with or without hyperactivity, also have one or more concurrent disorder of learning, emotion and/or behavior. Established experts describe practical implications of current research on ADD with Anxiety Disorders, ADD with Learning Disorders, ADD with Mood Disorders, ADD with Substance Abuse, and many other combinations of ADD with other comorbid disorders. <p>Increasingly ADD is being recognized as a widespread disorder which significantly impairs many children, adolescents and adults in work or school, family life, social relationships and self-esteem. This book provides accurate, up-to-date, research-based information on the diverse and complex ways in which ADDs impact individuals and their families. It describes how these complexities should be taken into account by all those who assess, treat, educate and care for children, adolescents and adults with ADHD--with and without hyperactivity.</p></p><h2>The Introverted Leader: Building on Your Quiet Strength</h2><p><b>Succeeding in an Extroverted Workplace</b><br><br>You don't have be an extrovert--or pretend to be one--to get to the top! Jennifer Kahnweiler points to Mark Zuckerberg, Arianna Huffington, and Warren Buffett as prime examples of self-identified introverts who have done quite well for themselves. In this new, expanded edition of her pioneering book, she lays out a well-tested four-step strategy introverts can use to build on their quiet strength and make it a source of great power. The book includes fresh information on the unique challenges faced by introverted women, how leaders can shape a more introvert-friendly workplace, customized hiring and coaching strategies for introverts, and the positive correlation between introverted leadership and company performance.</p><p><b>Jennifer B. Kahnweiler</b>, PhD, CSP, has shared her message about harnessing introvert power around the world, including in Vietnam, Australia, Germany, and Paraguay. Her clients include GE, NASA, Freddie Mac, and Boeing. She has been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and Fortune. She is also the author of Quiet Influence and The Genius of Opposites.What Is an<br> Introverted Leader?<br><br> Do you ever feel like extroverts get everything they ask for while your needs are passed over ... or ignored?<br><br> Are you drained by business socializing?<br><br> Do you feel like you are not heard at meetings?<br><br> Have you ever turned down a speech or interview request?<br><br> If so, you may be introverted, and you are not alone. Many respected executives, such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Andrea Jung, are naturally introverted.1 Other famous leaders, such as Mother Theresa, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King Jr., were thought to be introverted. The late Katharine Graham was introverted, and it is likely that President Barack Obama is an introvert. The list goes on.<br><br> A well-kept secret is that, like these well-known and successful introverts, there are millions of people who can experience deep discomfort and inhibition in interpersonal situations. This is not because there is something wrong with them. Introverts have a temperament that is more inner-focused, and they must adapt to an extroverted world, one that is primarily driven by interpersonal interactions. With estimates that almost 50 percent of the population2 and 40 percent of executives are introverted, you are certainly not alone. Yet, to be an effective leader, you have a responsibility to connect with employees, customers, and colleagues and, like other successful introverted leaders, you need to find ways to succeed.<br><br> An Overview of Introversion<br> and Extroversion<br><br> There is no one definition of introversion or extroversion that can be tied up neatly. However, it is an area of personality that can be best explained by a description of general tendencies. If you haven&#x2019;t taken the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (the MBTI) to determine your preference, doing a search online will reveal many resources to help you with this.<br><br> Figure 1. Typical Characteristics<br><br> image<br><br> However, I find that most people seem to recognize their introversion when presented with some typical characteristics. Let&#x2019;s review the list above in Figure 1 and see which side resonates with you more.<br><br> If you are torn between both sides of the chart, it is not a problem. You might ask yourself the question, &#x201c;If I had to be one for the rest of my life, which one would I choose?&#x201d; Some people have situational introversion. There are certain scenarios in which they reveal introverted tendencies. It is said that even Oprah Winfrey was tongue-tied when she met Nelson Mandela for the first time!<br><br> There is a difference between introversion and shyness. Shyness is driven by fear and social anxiety. Although the symptoms may overlap (e.g., avoidance of public speaking), introversion is a preference and should not be considered a problem.<br><br> Can Introverts Be Leaders?<br><br> Absolutely, introverts can be successful leaders. I define leaders very broadly. If you are someone who recognizes that you need to work through people to achieve results, then you are a leader. If you are not satisfied with the status quo and want to improve processes and make a difference, then you are a leader. If you want to help people, then you are a leader. I leave it up to you to define the term for yourself. Leaders have to make sure the job gets done, and they also need to plan for change, coach others, and work with other people to get results.<br><br> There is a strong case to be made for the success of introverted leaders. Go od to Great by Jim Collins has become a classic business book. In studying the characteristics of successful companies, Jim Collins found that every successful company he studied had a leader who exhibited what he called &#x201c;Level 5&#x201d; characteristics during times of transition. They demonstrated a focus on results, but equally important, and perhaps paradoxically, they each possessed personal humility. They displayed &#x201c;compelling modesty, were self-effacing and understated&#x201d;3; these qualities and this emotional intelligence seem very aligned with the introverted leader.<br><br> In a study published in CIO Magazine,4 senior executives said that a lack of empathy was a key cause of failure in leaders today. These results match research that was done by the guru of emotional intelligence, Daniel Goleman. He found that the best bosses have something called high social intelligence. This form of intelligence correlates more with attention and focus on relationships. Those with high social intelligence are able to connect with others and greatly influence the performance of their people.5<br><br> How Leaders Manage Their Introversion<br><br> Turn a Weakness into a Strength<br><br> In my consulting with successful business executives over the years, I have found many who have been candidly honest about being introverted. In fact, they tend to talk about the topic at length, as though they have never been asked about this &#x201c;secret.&#x201d; They approach introversion as they would any other challenging business problem and seek to understand which behaviors are working and which aren&#x2019;t. Then they develop a strategy and execute a plan.<br><br> The successful introverted leader actually turns what might be considered a weakness into a strength. One well-respected manager was given feedback in his career that he was too &#x201c;low key.&#x201d; In his future role as a senior leader he turned this laid-back persona into presence. He had a strong ability to project a calm confidence&#x2014;a sense of ease, poise, and self-assurance that transferred to all the people around him.<br><br> Another leader turned her disdain for large-group socializing into a chance to get her vision across to her team in different ways. She made a point of building on her preference for one-on-one conversations. As a result, she got to know each of her people, and she built clear communication channels and trust.<br><br> These leaders have found creative ways to adapt. In and out of diverse workplaces, one-on-one and in groups, the ongoing give and take with customers and colleagues is what gets results and ultimately makes the difference in whether or not you are a credible and respected leader, colleague, and employee.<br><br> Though she is far from a role model, Miranda Priestly, the ghastly boss (and &#x201c;closet introvert&#x201d; perhaps?) in the film The Devil Wears Prada uses a technique that serves her well. Her two assistants memorize the names, photo headshots, and trivia about all of her party guests, which they then unobtrusively whisper in her ear before each encounter.<br><br> One CEO I interviewed said that he managed his anxiety in meetings with subordinates by taking careful notes, not realizing how incredibly helpful this would be when he needed this information months later.<br><br> The power of silence is another characteristic that can serve as a strength. Many people are not comfortable with silence and try to fill the gaps with comments that are off the cuff, whereas the comments made by the introvert can be more thoughtful. Sid Milstein, VP Global BPO for EDS, an HP company, told me that you can convey a sense of reflective wisdom to your peers and your bosses because you &#x201c;hopefully, are considering facts and issues before speaking.&#x201d;<br><br> Introverts can access greater wisdom from within when their mind is quiet. They can choose their words carefully and correctly. An executive coach I know who has worked with many senior executives said that when these reflective leaders speak, what shows up is very powerful. Judy Gray, president and CEO of the Florida Society of Association of Executives said, &#x201c;The whole phenomenon of quiet yet effective leadership deserves to be recognized and appreciated. The passionately exuberant or charismatic leader initially has a leg up on capturing people&#x2019;s hearts and minds, but those characteristics alone are not what create sustainable progress or meaningful change.&#x201d; A really powerful, astute Ivy-League type years ago told her, &#x201c;The person in the room with the most power is the quietest.&#x201d;<br><br> Pausing and reflecting also helps keep introverted leaders from putting their feet in their mouths. One person I spoke with who works in politics expressed gratitude at being able to hold his tongue. Where he worked, one wrong word could have cost him his job.<br><br> When you are introverted, you also have more time to observe and read people. Mary Toland, a senior project manager, has been able to groom talent on her project team by coaching those who have receded into the background. She has developed empathy for introverted, emerging leaders, and shares a realistic view of what it takes to rise in the ranks and succeed in her organization. Mary is now passing this knowledge on.<br><br> This book will show you the many ways you can adapt your leadership style now and in the future. Just as you may complete Sudoku puzzles or learn a new language to stretch your brain, you can gain practical and proven tools to build on your quiet strength. The next chapter will clarify the tangible challenges you will likely experience as you move down the road toward being a successful introverted leader.</p><h2>Source Readings in Music History from Classical Antiquity Through the Romantic Era.</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

According to tradition St. Mark the Evangelist brought Christianity to Alexandria in the middle of the first century and was martyred in that city, which was to become the residence of Egypt&#x2019;s Coptic patriarchs for nearly eleven centuries. By the fourth century Egyptian monasticism had begun to flourish in the Egyptian deserts and countryside. The contributors to this volume, international specialists in Coptology from around the world, examine the various aspects of Coptic civilization in Alexandria and its environs and in the Egyptian deserts over the past two millennia. The contributions explore Coptic art, archaeology, architecture, language, and literature. The impact of Alexandrian theology and its cultural heritage as well as the archaeology of its <i>university</i> are highlighted. Christian epigraphy in the Kharga Oasis, the art and architecture of the Bagawat cemetery, and the archaeological site of Kellis (Ismant al-Kharab) with its Manichaean texts are also discussed.<br><b>Contributors </b>Elizabeth Agaiby, Fr.

Though of Jewish descent, he was baptised at an early age and remained a lifelong Catholic. He rapidly established himself as a formidable scholar, through studies of Ibsen and Blake and histories of English, Hungarian and world literature. He was a prolific essayist and reviewer, ranging across all the major European languages. Debarred by successive Jewish laws from working in a university, he was subjected to increasing persecution, and finally murdered in a forced labour camp in 1945. Pushkin Press publishes his novels <i>The Pendragon Legend</i>, <i>Oliver VII</i> and his masterpiece <i>Journey by Moonlight</i>, as well as the historical study<i> The Queen's Necklace</i> and <i>Love in a Bottle and Other Stories</i>."His love affair with literature was passionate, intense, and serious, but for all that it was never humorless, and it never lost the flirtatious and giddy quality of an adolescent crush. Reading Szerb on literature&#x2014;reading Szerb at all&#x2014;is like watching a lover dote on the object of his affections. . .&nbsp;It is the disparity between literary perfection and drab actuality that motivates us, in Szerb&#x2019;s view, to improve our world, to question its assumptions and tear at its established fabrics." <b>- Becca Rothfield, <i>The New Republic</i></b> <br><br>"Sophisticated, elegant and unpredictable."<b> - Jonathan Keates, TLS</b><br><br>"A writer of immense subtlety and generosity...

Durkheim&#39;s aphorism states that the concreteness of social facts is sociology&#39;s most fundamental phenomenon. Garfinkel argues that sociologists have, for a century or more, ignored this aphorism and treated social facts as theoretical, or conceptual, constructions. Garfinkel, in this new book, shows how and why sociology must restore Durkheim&#39;s aphorism, through an insistence on the concreteness of social facts that are produced by complex social practices enacted by participants in the social order.</p><p>Harold Garfinkel has been on the faculty of the sociology department at UCLA since 1954. Retired in 1987, he remains active as an emeritus professor. Anne Warfield Rawls received degrees in philosophy and sociology from Boston University in 1979 and 1983. Since that time she has worked to establish the philosophical implications of contemporary interactionist sociology and ethnomethodology.Anne Rawls's introductory essay is without doubt the most systematic, clear, valid, and resonate secondary source on what is called ethnomethodology. The Garfinkel papers live up to the promise of a well-reasoned extention of Durkheim's aphorism that points sociology to the natural order of concrete facts in the world. A close reading of this book is bound to be refreshing and stimulating. It is an essential task if one is to understand one viable variant on mechanistic, technically driven empiricism. (<i>Contemporary Sociology</i>)<br><br>Ethnomethdology's Program is a mine of rich insight into ethnomethodology's history; providing details of Garfinkel's intellectual biography, models of ethnomethodological study to which to refer, and alternative ways of thinking about the study of social order and the work of the social sciences. (<i>Linguistics &amp; Education</i>)<br><br>Ethnomethodology's Program is written in...[a] particular, expressive and careful manner. (Graham Button, Xerox Research Centre, Grenoble, France <i>Computer Supported Cooperative Work</i>)<br><br>This ambitious volume will not end the controversial discussions of ethnomethodology, but will certainly enrich them by providing enormous intellectual resources. Rawl's editing provides an in-depth, informed, and intelligible access to Garfinkel's thought, and the book will bring further recognition of the originality and significance of Garfinkel's many contributions (<i>American Journal of Sociology</i>)<br><br>In sum, Ethnomethodology 's Program : Working out Durkheim 's Aphorism is a challenging and dense extension of the initial work of Garfinkel. . . Sociologists already familiar with ethnomethodology will be delighted by these exciting presentations and sometimes unexpected, such as the phenomenon of the order over the telephone interviews, methods.

But William Bligh was one of the least violent disciplinarians in the British navy. It is this paradox that inspired Greg Dening to ask why the mutiny took place. His book explores the theatrical nature of what was enacted in the power-play on deck, on the beaches of Tahiti and in the murderous settlement at Pitcairn, on the altar stones and temples of sacrifice, and on the catheads from which men were hanged. Part of the key lies in the curious puzzle of Mr Bligh&#39;s bad language.</p><p>William Bligh was one of the least violent disciplinarians in the British navy. It is this paradox that inspires an analysis of the infamous voyage of the Bounty in the context of other explorations and revolutions as well as the disclosure of more startling revelations concerning the mutiny.Captain Bligh and the voyage of the Bounty are the starting point of this new study of the famous mutiny in history, literature and film. By juxtaposing an account of the mutiny with an analysis of its evolving place in history and culture, Mr. Bligh&#39;s Bad Language offers a new interpretation of the mutiny in the context of its historical and cultural representations. Beginning with an analysis of naval life and ritual aboard the Bounty, Greg Dening argues that the famous mutiny did not take place due to punitive violence, as Captain Bligh is shown to be one of the least violent of British Navy captains. Instead, he argues, Captain Bligh misunderstood the theatrical nature of shipboard life, especially his role as captain. Moving to a larger stage, the scope of the book shifts to the reception of the mutiny in England in the eighteenth century. Connecting the voyage of the Bounty with the cultural exploration and revolutions of the age, Greg Dening shows that a mythology arose almost immediately around the participants of the mutiny and their actions, a mythology that has been continually reinterpreted into twentieth century literature and film. Gracefully written, Mr. Bligh&#39;s Bad Language is an anthropological history of a new order, weaving the history of the Bounty with its role in our culture. Using a range of influences from Diderot to Foucault, Greg Dening reconstructs the voyage of the Bounty as moving between history and mythology, circumventing a dozen discourses.</p><h2>Practice Book for Conceptual Integrated Science</h2><p>This introduction to the physical and life sciences emphasises concepts over computation and treats equations as a guide to thinking so the reader can connect ideas.</p><p></p><h2>My Bondage and My Freedom (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><strong>'It was said to me, "Better have a little of the plantation manner of speech than not; 'tis not best that you seem too learned."'</strong><br><br>Appearing in 1855, <em>My Bondage and My Freedom</em> is the second autobiography written by Frederick Douglass (1818-95), a man who was born into slavery in Maryland and who went on to become the most famous antislavery author, orator, philosopher, essaysist, historian, intellectual, statesman and freedom-fighter in US history. An instant bestseller, Douglass's autobiography tells the story of his early life as lived in 'bondage' and of his later life as lived in a 'freedom' that was in name only. Recognizing that his body and soul were bought and sold by white slaveholders in the US South, he soon realized his story was being traded by white northern antislavery campaigners. Douglass's <em>My Bondage and My Freedom</em> is a literary, intellectual and philosophical tour-de-force in which he betrays his determination not only to speak but to write 'just the word that seemed to me the word to be written by me.' <br><br>This new edition examines Douglass's biography, literary strategies and political activism alongside his depiction of Black women's lives and his narrative histories of Black heroism.

By the end of the century, they had become extremely profitable and powerful companies, instrumental in putting millions of Americans in their homes. So why does the government now want them dead?<br><br>In 2008, the U.S. Treasury put Fannie and Freddie into a life-support state known as "conservatorship" to prevent their failure--and worldwide economic chaos. The two companies, which were always controversial, have become a battleground. Today, Fannie and Freddie are profitable again but still in conservatorship. Their profits are being redirected toward reducing the federal deficit, which leaves them with no buffer should they suffer losses again. China and Japan are big owners of Fannie and Freddie securities, and they want to ensure the safety of their investments--which helps explain why the government is at an impasse about what to do.

In Foods that Fit a Unique You, authors W. Lee Cowden, MD and Connie Strasheim prove that no two people have the same biochemistry and needs, and that one-size-fit-all food plans are therefore inadequate for determining what you need to eat for optimal health, fitness and weight maintenance. In Foods that Fit a Unique You, the authors teach you how to identify truly healthy foods, and look and feel your best, by taking into account six individual factors, including: body pH, food allergies, metabolic type, gastrointestinal function, and your current health condition. In Foods that Fit a Unique You, the authors provide general guidelines on how to identify and choose healthy foods, and then teach you how to find the foods that will best fit your unique body, based on the above factors. They then show you how to avoid food allergens, optimize your digestion and heal your gastrointestinal tract, so that you can get the most out of your meals.</p><p></p><h2>Real World Postscript: Techniques from Postscript Professionals</h2><p>Illustrates the full graphics productions capabilities of the PostScript language, with a discussion of PostScript as a design tool, information on letter-spacing and typefaces, screens, halftones, and colors</p><p></p><h2>Mentor Texts: Teaching Writing Through Children&#39;s Literature, K-6</h2><p><p>How do children's book authors create the wonder that we feel when reading our favorite books?

I remember sharing 'My Most Unforgettable Character' with my riding instructor, Mick Warmington. I remember his face while he was reading it. I still get chills when I think about it. That's when I realized the power of the written word. That's when I first dreamed about writing and publishing books and encouraging my future students to do the same."</p><p>Lynne is currently literacy a Co-director of the Pennsylvania Writing and Literature Project; adjunct professor for Arcadia University; and a legacy ambassador/tour guide for Pearl S. Buck International. She also does independent consulting work for the PA Writing Project and serves on the board for Chester County Reading Association as well as the board for Eta Chapter of Alpha Delta Kappa. For the past six years, Lynne has facilitated a senior citizen writing group for Upper Moreland Township through Upper Moreland School District.</p><p>Her latest book is a collaborative work with her colleague, Diane Dougherty. It targets grades K-6 and demonstrates how to embed grammar and mechanics instruction throughout the day. "We think that grammar matters, but we don't believe in workbooks and isolated lessons. We think the teaching of grammar should be both explicit and implicit. Every day teachers need to tuck in grammar and mechanics wherever and whenever it is applicable. That means your modeling or discussion might occur in social studies as easily as it might occur in writing and reading workshop."</p><p>Lynne co-authored three books with friend and colleague, Rose Cappelli. "We based everything on classroom samples and our work with children. An important part was including anecdotes--advice we received from Shelley Harwayne. It helped to keep a notebook of our ideas."</p><p>Lynne describes her approach to professional development as hands on and interactive, using the gradual release of responsibility model. "Very practical and user-friendly--let's take it right back to the classroom."</p><p>Lynne has two goddaughters and three Welsh Corgi dogs. She recently acquired a husband, Ralph, who has the patience of a saint. "He supports me in all my endeavors and is my best friend." Lynne loves to plant flowers, read books, write poetry, and spend time at the seashore with her husband, friends, and goddaughters. She taught herself how to play the guitar and loves the old folk songs written by Peter, Paul, and Mary and Pete Seeger. She especially loves the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Rod Stewart, James Taylor, Simon and Garfunkel, Jim Morrison, and Gordon Lightfoot.</p><br><br><p>Rose comes from a family of musicians and teachers, both of which have greatly influenced her life. A volunteer job in high school led her to pursue work with hearing and language impaired children. But she knew that in order to be successful with this population,&nbsp;she needed to better understand the relationship of language acquisition to reading and writing. This led her to become a reading specialist as well as to&nbsp;her involvement with the PA Writing and Literature Project.</p><p>She received her bachelor's degree in Deaf Education from Pennsylvania State University and her master's degree in reading from West Chester University. She also holds an elementary certification from Immaculata University. Rose has worked as a reading specialist in the West Chester Area School District and as a teacher consultant and course coordinator at the Pennsylvania Writing and Literature Project.</p><p>Her approach to staff development follows the premise of "teachers teaching teachers" which is the basis of the work done by PAWLP. "I want to bring what I have learned in the classroom to my work with teachers, so all the things I suggest are classroom tested, and the teaching beliefs I have formed come from my work with children. I have been greatly influenced by the work of Regie Routman, Lucy Calkins, Donald Graves, Katie Wood Ray, and others who I consider my mentors and who have guided my practice and understandings.</p><p>"I think the best way to approach staff development is to guide teachers in reflecting on their own practice, give them the opportunity to try out some new strategies, share thoughts and ideas, and then think about where the new ideas could fit in with or change their beliefs. Reflection is a big part of working with teachers.</p><p>"The writing of&nbsp;<i>Mentor Texts</i>&nbsp;was truly a collaborative process with my friend and colleague, Lynne Dorfman. While we worked on some parts separately, I think our best work came on the days we spent sitting in my sunroom pouring through countless children's books, and the conversations that ensued. Working together, we had the opportunity to question and search for answers, clarify understandings, and think about the best way to present ideas to teachers so that they could try them out with their students. And that brings me back to reflection. Writing the book gave us time to reflect and put into words the strategies we have found to be successful in using with our students. We followed the same process in writing&nbsp;<i>Nonfiction Mentor Texts</i>and&nbsp;<i>Poetry Mentor Texts</i>. With all three projects, the writing journey was a learning journey."</p><p>Rose is married with two grown children, Brian and Ann. She and her husband, Allan, live in Chester County, PA.&nbsp; She enjoys gardening and golf, and of course, reading. "I have been trying to learn how to play golf for a few years now. Going through the process of learning something new that doesn't come easily or naturally to me has given me new insights into what some kids go through who struggle with reading and/or writing. I have been reminded of the whole learning process and the importance of modeling and guided practice."</p>"Expertly written in a conversational style, employing numerous illustrative anecdotes, and thoroughly 'user-friendly,' <i>Mentor Texts</i> should be considered mandatory reading for anyone charged with the responsibility of teaching writing at the elementary school level." - <i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br><br><p>Mentor Texts:Teaching Writing Through Children's Literature by Lynne R. Dorfman and Rose Cappelli is so much more than I expected.&nbsp; It is loaded with specific examples of styles and strategies that students can borrow from favorite authors as the students build their own style of writing.&nbsp; The index at the end is a goldmine of resources.&nbsp; No more scouring the Internet for ideas!&nbsp; For me, the book is also a refresher course on children's literature that is helping me bring a broader selection of books to my students.&nbsp; I was using the ideas in this book in my writing lessons before I was even halfway through it!&nbsp;<br> Linda Solaya, Third Grade Teacher</p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages: Volume 2, Part 1, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Scotland, etc. (Cambridge Library Collection - Medieval History)</h2><p>Hastings Rashdall (1858-1924) first published The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages in 1895.

Today, Namier is associated with the belief that the thoughts and actions of elites matter most, and with a view of politics in which those who enter public life do so only in pursuit of personal and material advantage. This exaggerated view has made him a hero to social and political conservatives, and a demonic figure to the Left. Preoccupied by nationalism, empire, and human motivation, Namier also remains famous in academic circles for supposedly declaring that any reference to ideas in political discourse was nothing more than &#39;flapdoodle&#39;. The first biography of Namier in over thirty years, this book is based on a vast range of sources, including rich new archival material.</p><p><br><strong>D. W.

Taylor</i> and <i>Hugh Trevor-Roper </i>'Hayton has left hardly any relevant archive or printed source uncombed ... The result is a definitive account of its subject. As histories of historians go, it definitely ranks with Haslam on EH Carr, Sisman on Taylor and Trevor-Roper, and Bentley on Butterfield.' Miles Taylor, University of York 'One of the most important books in British historiography for decades. Nobody is better placed than David Hayton to recover Namier's unsurpassed technical mastery of historical problems. But Hayton is equally alert to Namier's chequered life and overpowering personality, while his deft and unobtrusively witty style makes this a pleasure to read. A masterpiece.' Colin Kidd, University of St Andrews 'An important and compelling study. The product of many years of research, this scholarly and well-written biography goes beyond a familiar English environment to expand Namier's significance as as a major figure in European and Jewish historiography.'

And that&#39;s just the usual. Bringing together a unique group of designers, illustrators, cartoonists, and artists, The Ganzfeld provides the crispest picture of the state of graphic arts to be found anywhere. Issue number 3 features a unique collaboration between The Ice Storm author Rick Moody and artist Fred Tomaselli, a new picture story by designer Geoff McFetridge, and even an illustrated essay by Alfred Hitchcock. Lengthy comics and picture stories are contributed by an international group including Ren e French, Ron Reg Jr., and Adam Dent. This installation of the anthology also puts the spotlight on history: Lawrence Weschler writes about Brueghe, two prominent design writers, Andrea Codrington and Julie Lasky, each contribute articles on lost design arts of the past, while the Hairy Who (Jim Nutt, Karl Wirsum, etc.) are given a 30 page retrospective. An invaluable resource and pleasure source for anyone interested in the graphic arts and all their various manifestations.</p><p>It's not clear whether the third issue of <i>The Ganzfeld</i> should be regarded as a periodical or a book--but either way, it's gloriously illustrated and esoterically insightful. Its graphically extravagant essays often consider the spectacular results when worlds collide. The cover depicts an ordinary moth given Blakean magnitude by an EverSmart Pro Scanner. Julie Lasky profiles Tony Sarg, who turned tiny cartoon characters into godlike giants by inventing Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Hitchcock explains the elaborately artificial Rube Goldberg devices needed to create "reality" in what he called "My Most Exciting Picture" (Rope). Peter Blegvad illustrates the amazing impact on his imagination of the light-bulb-in-the-milk-glass scene from Hitchcock's Suspicion&#x2014;it provoked an intellectually superb and astoundingly extended poetical meditation. Lawrence Weschsler unveils his lost essay on Edward Snow, the world's strangest explicator of Bruegel and Vermeer. The Ganzfeld 3 is like that spore that invades the ant's brain in Weschsler's book on the Museum of Jurassic Technology: once it gets inside your head, your imagination will never be the same. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><h2>The Universal History of Computing: From the Abacus to the Quantum Computer</h2><p>A brilliant follow-up to a landmark international bestseller <p>"Suppose every instrument could by command or by anticipation of need execute its function on its own; suppose that spindles could weave of their own accord, and plectra strike the strings of zithers by themselves; then craftsmen would have no need of hand-work, and masters have no need of slaves." &#x2013;Aristotle Called the Indiana Jones of arithmetic, Georges Ifrah embarked in 1974 on a ten-year quest to discover where numbers come from and what they say about us.

In The Universal History of Computing, Ifrah continues his exhilarating exploration into the fascinating world of numbers. In this fun, engaging but no less learned book, he traces the development of computing from the invention of the abacus to the creation of the binary system three centuries ago to the incredible conceptual, scientific, and technical achievements that made the first modern computers possible. He shows us how various cultures, scientists, and industries across the world struggled to break free of the tedious labor of mental calculation and, as a result, he reveals the evolution of the human mind. Evoking the excitement and joy that accompanied the grand mathematical undertakings throughout history, Ifrah takes us along as he revisits a multitude of cultures, from Roman times and the Chinese Common Era to twentieth-century England and America. We meet mathematicians, visionaries, philosophers, and scholars from every corner of the world and from every period of history.

Former math teacher Georges Ifrah has devoted his life to tracking down traces of our early calculating tools and reporting on them with charm and verve. <i>The Universal History of Computing: From the Abacus to Quantum Computing</i> gives a grand title to a grand subject, and Ifrah makes good on his promise of universality by leaping far back in time and spanning all of the inhabited continents. If his scope is vast, his stories and details are still engrossing. Readers will hang on to the stories of 19th-century inventors who converged on multiplication machines and other, more general "engines," and better understand the roots of biological and quantum computation. Ifrah has great respect for our ancestors and their work, and he transmits this feeling to his readers with humor and humility. His timelines, diagrams, and concordance help the reader who might be unfamiliar with foreign concepts of numbers and computation keep up with his narrative. By the end, his slight bias against strong artificial intelligence comes through, but he is careful to acknowledge the future's unforeseeable nature and suggest that we keep our minds open.

Economists need a richer appreciation of behavior, ethics, culture, and narrative&#x2015;all of which the great writers teach better than anyone.</p><p><i>Cents and Sensibility</i> demonstrates the benefits of a freewheeling dialogue between economics and the humanities by addressing a wide range of problems drawn from the economics of higher education, the economics of the family, and the development of poor nations. It offers new insights about everything from the manipulation of college rankings to why some countries grow faster than others.

In Old World countries such as France, Spain, and Italy, small family vineyards and cooperative wineries abound. In New World regions like the United States and Australia, the industry is dominated by a handful of very large producers. This is the first book to trace the economic and historical forces that gave rise to very distinctive regional approaches to creating wine.</p><br><p> James Simpson shows how the wine industry was transformed in the decades leading up to the First World War. Population growth, rising wages, and the railways all contributed to soaring European consumption even as many vineyards were decimated by the vine disease phylloxera. At the same time, new technologies led to a major shift in production away from Europe's traditional winemaking regions. Small family producers in Europe developed institutions such as regional appellations and cooperatives to protect their commercial interests as large integrated companies built new markets in America and elsewhere.

Lapsley, author of <i>Bottled Poetry: Napa Winemaking from Prohibition to the Modern Era</i></b></p><p>"Conventional wine histories typically give us the ch�teau, the region, or the country. Simpson's ambitious work instead puts at the center and in global perspective the wine sector as a whole. This viewpoint provides valuable insight into struggles over the commoditization of wine, tensions within commodity chains, the challenge to the Old World of the New, and battles between brand, <i>terroir</i>, and varietal. The result is a refreshingly new and engrossing modern history of a global trade."<b>--Paul Duguid, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"Simpson fills a void in wine economics. We learn about environmental issues, overproduction, export crises, institutional responses, the eternal competition with beer, and the rise of wine production in the New World.

Now this groundbreaking new translation--the first to be based on the original text published in November 1899--brings us a more readable, more accurate, and more coherent picture of Freud's masterpiece.<br> The first edition of <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em> is much shorter than its subsequent editions; each time the text was reissued, from 1909 onwards, Freud added to it. The most significant, and in many ways the most unfortunate addition, is a 50-page section devoted to the kind of mechanical reading of dream symbolism--long objects equal male genitalia, etc.--that has gained popular currency and partially obscured Freud's more profound insights into dreams. In the original version presented here, Freud's emphasis falls more clearly on the use of words in dreams and on the difficulty of deciphering them. Without the strata of later additions, readers will find here a clearer development of Freud's central ideas--of dream as wish-fulfillment, of the dream's manifest and latent content, of the retelling of dreams as a continuation of the dreamwork, and much more. Joyce Crick's translation is lighter and faster-moving than previous versions, enhancing the sense of dialogue with the reader, one of Freud's stylistic strengths, and allowing us to follow Freud's theory as it evolved through difficult cases, apparently intractable counter-examples, and fascinating analyses of Freud's own dreams.<br> The restoration of Freud's classic is a major event, giving us in a sense a new work by one of this century' most startling, original, and influential thinkers.</p><p>Whether we love or hate Sigmund Freud, we all have to admit that he revolutionized the way we think about ourselves. Much of this revolution can be traced to <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, the turn-of-the-century tour de force that outlined his theory of unconscious forces in the context of dream analysis. Introducing the id, the superego, and their problem child, the ego, Freud advanced scientific understanding of the mind immeasurably by exposing motivations normally invisible to our consciousness. While there's no question that his own biases and neuroses influenced his observations, the details are less important than the paradigm shift as a whole. After Freud, our interior lives became richer and vastly more mysterious.<p> These mysteries clearly bothered him--he went to great (often absurd) lengths to explain dream imagery in terms of childhood sexual trauma, a component of his theory jettisoned mid-century, though now popular among recovered-memory therapists. His dispassionate analyses of his own dreams are excellent studies for cognitive scientists wishing to learn how to sacrifice their vanities for the cause of learning. Freud said of the work contained in <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, "Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime." One would have to feel quite fortunate to shake the world even once. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Freud&#39;s discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in the entire history of psychology. Dreams, according to his theory, represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes.</p><h2>Robert Whitman: Playback</h2><p>One of the pioneers of performance and multimedia work, constantly cited as key to the burgeoning postwar genres now considered standard fare in art galleries and museums, Robert Whitman's work of the 1960s and 1970s has long been inaccessible because of its ephemeral nature. This publication and the exhibition it accompanies are the first to reexamine his seminal early work, begun under the influence of Allan Kaprow in the late 1950s. Early performances, in conjunction with fellow artists Jim Dine and Claes Oldenburg, paralleled exhibitions in some of the more influential experimental galleries of the time, including Hansa, Reuben and Martha Jackson. The 1960s saw Whitman become highly interested in multimedia projections, which he incorporated into installations as well as into his increasingly elaborate performances. Together with Robert Rauschenberg, Billy Kl�ver and others, Whitman later spearheaded the collaborations between artists and scientists that resulted in such landmark exhibitions as <i>Art &amp; Technology</i>, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1971 and <i>Pavillion (E.A.T.)</i>, at the Pepsi pavillion, Expo 70, in Osaka, Japan. An incisive volume for artists and scholars interested in the major movements of the 1960s and 1970s, including happenings, performance, theater, pop art, multimedia installation work and interdisciplinary collaboration.</p><p></p><h2>Dracula/Frankenstein (Golden Heritage Series)</h2><p>The story of the Carpathian count who drank human blood to stay alive, and the scientist who seeks to instill life in a creature assembled from the bodies of the dead</p><p>These classic novels contain stunning description and tense action sequences. And these two performances are outstanding. However, the works were written for a nineteenth-century readership accustomed to a more leisurely pace. These abridgments cut all excess but provide everything essential to the stories. What's more, shifting readers for each section highlights FRANKENSTEIN's nested narratives. This approach allows listeners to distinguish between Victor and his creation and emphasizes Shelley's skill in constructing her story of inquiry and alienation. Having a full cast read DRACULA demonstrates how mysterious the vampire is, since no one knows the whole story. Both productions also use period music to set the mood.

In Taiwan, he is the object of a veritable cult; in the People&#x2019;s Republic of China, he is paid homage as &#x201c;pioneer of the revolution,&#x201d; making possible the Party&#x2019;s claims of continuity with the national past. Western scholars, on the other hand, have tended to question the myth of Sun Yat-sen by stressing the man&#x2019;s weaknesses, the thinker&#x2019;s incoherences, and the revolutionary leader&#x2019;s many failures.<br>This book argues that the life and work of Sun Yat-sen have been distorted both by the creation of the myth and by the attempts at demythification. Its aim is to provide a fresh overall evaluation of the man and the events that turned an adventurer into the founder of the Chinese Republic and the leader of a great nationalist movement. The Sun Yat-sen who emerges from this rigorously researched account is a muddled politician, an opportunist with generous but confused ideas, a theorist without great originality or intellectual rigor.<br>But the author demonstrates that the importance of Sun Yat-sen lies elsewhere. A Cantonese raised in Hawaii and Hong Kong, he was a product of maritime China, the China of the coastal provinces and overseas communities, open to foreign influences and acutely aware of the modern Western world (he was fund-raising in Denver when the eleventh attempt to bring down the Chinese empire finally succeeded). In facing the problems of change, of imitating the West, of rejecting or adapting tradition, he instinctively grasped the aspirations of his time, understood their force, and crystallized them into practical programs.<br>Sun Yat-sen&#x2019;s gifts enabled him to foresee the danger that technology might represent to democracy, stressed the role of infrastructures (transport, energy) in economic modernization, and looked forward to a new style of diplomatic and international economic relations based upon cooperation that bypassed or absorbed old hostilities. These &#x201c;utopias&#x201d; of his, at which his contemporaries heartily jeered, now seem to be so many prophecies.</p><p>&#x201c;By setting Sun Yat-sen in his proper historical context, this excellent biography not only resuscitates a major historical figure but constitutes one of the best histories we have of the late Qing and early Republican period.&#x201d;&#x2014;Frederic Wakeman, University of California, Berkeley<br>&#x201c;This is a most welcome book, one that everyone interested in modern China has wanted for a long while.

The sisters became so skilled that Lister entrusted them with his great work, <i>Histori� Conchyliorum</i>, assembled between 1685 and 1692. This first comprehensive study of conchology consisted of more than one thousand copperplates of shells and mollusks collected from around the world. <i>Martin Lister and his Remarkable Daughters</i> reconstructs the creation of this masterwork, presenting original drawings, engraved copperplates, draft prints, and photographs of the finished books.<br><br> Susanna and Anna portrayed the shells of this collection not only as curious and beautiful objects, but also as specimens of natural history, rendering them with sensitivity and keen scientific empiricism.

Beals's explicit goal was to expose the corruption of Cuban dictator Gerardo Machado and the long, torturous relationship between the United States and its island neighbor. The photographs Evans made during his visit to Cuba are fascinating for both their subject matter and the evidence they provide of the young photographer's artistic development. Walker Evans: Cuba brings together more than sixty of these images-all from the Getty Museum's extensive holdings of the photographer's work-along with an essay by the noted writer and commentator Andrei Codrescu. Codrescu's spirited text helps to provide a sense of the aesthetic and political forces that were shaping Evans's art in the early 1930s. He argues that Evans's photographs are the work of a young artist whose temperament was distinctly at odds with Beals's impassioned rhetoric. Looking closely at individual photographs, Codrescu shows that Evans was just beginning to combine his early, formalist aesthetic with the social concerns that would figure so prominently in his later work. Evans's images and Codrescu's lively, insightful essay provide a compelling study of a major artist at an important juncture in his career.</p><p><br><strong>Andrei Codrescu</strong> is a poet, novelist, essayist, and professor of English at Louisiana State University. He is the author of <em>Ay, Cuba!</em> and the editor of <em>Exquisite Corpse: A Journal of Letters &amp; Life</em>. <strong>Judith Keller</strong> is associate curator of photographs at the Getty Museum and the author of <em>Walker Evans:</em> <em>The Getty Museum Collection</em>.<br>Evans' 1933 Cuban photographs aren't as familiar as those in his famous collaboration with James Agee, <i>Let Us Now Praise </i>Famous Men (1936). Made for a Marxist polemic against the Machado dictatorship, they show, Codrescu says in his appreciative essay, people looking less miserable and downtrodden than the text led readers to expect. Beggars, itinerants, hard laborers, and a peasant family come to Havana--nearly all look self-possessed and strong, if often exhausted. Many middle-class people also show up (you can tell by their shoes, Codrescu observes), and some young women and children are hard to read--they could be prostitutes and street urchins, respectively, or not. There are also sterling pictures of wall paintings, signs, and architectural features, with and without any people in them. Codrescu cogently argues that the Cuban pictures show Evans moving on from preoccupation with the formal beauty of buildings and things and discovering how to make pictures of people that are charged with narrative implications.

Elements of continuity with the classical and medieval past are evident in the persistence of a humor-based view of the body and of illness. At the same time new theories of the body emerged to challenge established ideas in medical circles. In recent years, scholars have explored this terrain with increasingly fascinating results, often revising our previous understanding of issues relating to the way in which early modern Europeans discussed the body, health and disease. In order to understand these and related processes, historians are increasingly aware of the way in which every aspect of medical care and provision in early modern Europe was shaped by the social, religious, political and cultural concerns of the age.<br></p><p>Peter Elmer is Senior Lecturer of History of Science, Technology and Medicine, The Open University.<br></p><h2>Sound Innovations for Concert Band, Bk 1: A Revolutionary Method for Beginning Musicians (Trombone), Book &amp; Online Media</h2><p>Sound Innovations for Concert Band is a revolutionary, flexible, and comprehensive method that combines time-tested educational concepts, input from thousands of teachers, and advances in modern technology.

Ferguson</i> in 1896, when he declared, "Our Constitution is color-blind." But in other judicial decisions--as well as in some areas of his life--Harlan's actions directly contradicted the essence of his famous statement. Similarly, Harlan was called the people's judge for favoring income tax and antitrust laws, yet he also upheld doctrines that benefited large corporations. <br><br>Examining these and other puzzles in Harlan's judicial career, Linda Przybyszewski draws on a rich array of previously neglected sources--including the verbatim transcripts of his 1897-98 lectures on constitutional law, his wife's 1915 memoirs, and a compilation of opinions, drawn up by Harlan himself, that he wanted republished. Her thoughtful examination demonstrates how Harlan inherited the traditions of paternalism, nationalism, and religious faith; how he reshaped these traditions in light of his experiences as a lawyer, political candidate, and judge; and how he justified the vision of the law he wrote. <br><br>An innovative combination of personal and judicial biography, this book makes an insightful contribution to American constitutional and intellectual history.<br><br></p><p>"Clearly a book . . . that all judicial scholars will have to take note of in the future."-- <i>Law and History Review</i> <br>Combining judicial and personal biography, this book illuminates the legal thinking and vision of Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan, who served from 1877-1911.</p><h2>Personal Finance</h2><p>Decisions students make today can affect not only their life now but have an impact on their future.

The book conveys both an understanding of shared religious practices and orientations and a sense of how individual men and women imagine, represent, and transform popular religious practices within the time and space of their own lives. This work is original in three ways. First, the author investigates Penang Chinese religious practice as a total field of religious practice, suggesting ways in which the religious culture, including spirit-mediumship, has been transformed in the conjuncture with modernity. Second, the book emphasizes the way in which socially marginal spirit mediums use a religious anti-language and unique religious rituals to set themselves apart from mainstream society. Third, the study investigates Penang Chinese religion as the product of a specific history, rather than presenting an overgeneralized overview that claims to represent a single "Chinese religion."</p><p>&#x201c;This richly detailed study of spirit mediums manages at once to portray an ethnically mixed society in the throes of modern change, and to illuminate the millennial role of spirit-medium performance in Chinese popular cultural traditions.&#x201d;&#x2014;Donald S.

He was the last surviving castrato singer of the Sistine Chapel choir, and the only one of the castrati whose voice survives in any solo recording. The ethereal, haunting quality of his voice hints at why this extraordinary sound was so highly prized for centuries in the opera houses of Europe. The castrato tradition became established in Italy in the late 16th century, when Pope Clement VIII gave it his sanction. By the 17th century the castrati had moved onto the secular operatic stage, where they were feted as the 'pop stars' of their day. Few 'normal' singers, male or female, came close to matching their fame and success. But by the 19th century their continued existence had become an embarrassment, and when Moreschi joined the Sistine Chapel in 1883, there were only six castrati left in the choir, and by 1903 they were officially no more. The strange and lonely life of Alessandro Moreschi was lived in the shadows of great events and great institutions, his personality glimpsed only by inference and allusion. Written by an acclaimed musicologist, who as a counter-tenor has performed much of the repertoire written for castrati, this is a perceptive and informed study of the last survivor of a perennially intriguing part of Western cultural history.</p></p><p>Nicholas Clapton&#x2019;s career as a counter-tenor has seen him particularly involved in performing the repertoire of the great castrati. He is a professor of Singing at the Royal Academy of Music in London and also teaches at the Conservatoire in Budapest.&#39;...

Though written for the <i>Washington Post</i>, these tales of the city garden travel well. This book, often dog-eared and battered, is found in gardeners' homes all across the U.S.--not just in the South, but in Minnesota, Alaska, and the <i>other</i> Washington. After reading a single page--any page--you'll realize why. Many gardeners quote Mitchell's line, "It is a great joy the day we discover that we can learn things without actually having to make the mistakes ourselves." He regales us with his mistakes, recording the frustration caused by stubbornly planting where his beloved dogs insisted on sleeping or by thoughtless activity ("I speared a superb lily bulb today"), hoping we will profit from his own gardening mishaps. We can and do, but we profit just as much by his company as his advice, which is so clearly the fruit of long and direct experience.Henry Mitchell, who died in November 1993, was one of America&#39;s most beloved garden writers. He was especially famous for his weekly &#34;Earthman&#34; columns in the Washington Post.</p><h2>Annual Editions: Race and Ethnic Relations, 20/e</h2><p>The <strong>Annual Editions</strong> series is designed to provide convenient inexpensive access to a wide range of current articles from some of the most respected magazines, newspapers and journals published today. <strong>Annual Editions</strong> are updated on a regular basis through a continuous monitoring of over 300 periodical sources.

Acclaimed historian Mark Mazower forces us to set aside the popular myth that the UN miraculously rose from the ashes of World War II as the guardian of a new and peaceful global order, offering instead a strikingly original interpretation of the UN's ideological roots, early history, and changing role in world affairs.</p><br><p> Mazower brings the founding of the UN brilliantly to life. He shows how the UN's creators envisioned a world organization that would protect the interests of empire, yet how this imperial vision was decisively reshaped by the postwar reaffirmation of national sovereignty and the unanticipated rise of India and other former colonial powers. This is a story told through the clash of personalities, such as South African statesman Jan Smuts, who saw in the UN a means to protect the old imperial and racial order; Raphael Lemkin and Joseph Schechtman, Jewish intellectuals at odds over how the UN should combat genocide and other atrocities; and Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, who helped transform the UN from an instrument of empire into a forum for ending it.</p><br><p> A much-needed historical reappraisal of the early development of this vital world institution, <i>No Enchanted Palace</i> reveals how the UN outgrew its origins and has exhibited an extraordinary flexibility that has enabled it to endure to the present day.</p></p><p><br><p>"This is a sprawling tale told with great energy, verve, and insight.

For the Chinese master Huangbo Xiyun (d. 850), the mind is enlightenment itself if we can only let go of our normal way of thinking.<br> <br>The celebrated translation of this work by John Blofeld, <i>The Zen Teaching of Huang Po</i>, introduced countless readers to Zen over the last sixty years. Huangbo&#x2019;s work is also a favorite of contemporary Zen (Korean: Seon) Master Subul, who has revolutionized the strict monastic practice of koans and adapted it for lay meditators in Korea and around the world to make swift progress in intense but informal retreats. Devoting themselves to enigmatic questions with their whole bodies, retreatants are frustrated in their search for answers and arrive thereby at a breakthrough experience of their own buddha nature. <br> <br><i>A Bird in Flight Leaves No Trace</i> is a bracing call for the practitioner to let go and thinking and unlock the buddha within.</p><p>Seon Master Subul Sunim (b. 1953) is an influential monk in Korean Buddhism&#x2019;s Jogye Order, the largest Buddhist tradition in Korea.

This commentary on the teachings of the great Chan master Huangbo (d. 850) by an eminent contemporary Korean Seon master introduces Western readers and practitioners not only to that vital role but also to the vitality of the contemporary Korean Zen tradition. Seon (Zen) Master Subul is a preeminent teacher of&nbsp;ganhwa Seon, &#x201c;the Zen of examining meditative topics,&#x201d; and he orients his approach to Huangbo&#x2019;s text around this technique, thus combining the best of medieval Chinese Zen and contemporary Korean Zen. This book should be inspiring to serious practitioners of Zen, in particular, but also to all Buddhist practitioners.&#x201d;&nbsp; Author: Mu Soeng, Resident Scholar at the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies<br><br>&#x201c;How wonderful to have a clear new translation of the Zen teachings of Huangbo, one of the greatest masters of Zen&#x2019;s golden era.

On all levels - from the exploration of the philosophy of mind/brain, through the brilliant critique of the drug cowboys who want to merely keep us "level" and smiling, to the intense work of being with his patients in a truly mutual, whole, and making-whole therapy process - Dr. Frattaroli's find book insists that we wake up and embrace the essence of that which is always with us, our souls." (Samuel Shem, author of <i>The House of God</i> and <i>Mount Misery</i>) <br><br> '"This is a terrific book. Elio Frattaroli illuminates hugely important truths about our innate human complexity in this fascinating excursion through psychology, neuroscience, literature and quantum physics. Along the path, he deflates several overblown sacred cows of 'modern medicine' while revealing himself to be humble, honest and a truly gifted psychiatrist." (John L. Schwartz, MD Editor in Chief, <i>Psychiatric Times</i>) <br><br> "In this insightful, comprehensive book, Dr. Frattaroli offers an inside view of how psychotherapy works to change lives. As a psychologist, novelist and patient, whom psychoanalysis freed to be creative, I recommend this book as a valuable tool for professionals and as an illuminating resource for anyone interested in how human beings can benefit from facing the unconscious fantasies that hold them prisoner." (Lucy Daniels, Ph.D., author of <i>Caleb My Son, High On a Hill, With a Woman's Voice) <br><br> "We are not mechanisms! With the clarity of an insider, psychotherapist and analyst Dr. Elio Frattaroli takes on the current psychiatric infatuation with biological reductionism. As persons, we are more than the sum of our neurological interactions, even more than our neuroses. We are spirit and soul. With verve and freshness, Dr. Fratteroli leads us with practical steps toward a soul-centered psychotherapy. A lucid and important work." (Terry Real, author of <i>I Don't Want to Talk About It: The Secret Legacy of Male Depression"</i>) <br><br> "This is an absolutely necessary book. In America, we give dangerous psychiatric drugs to our children and ask 'Should I take Prozac?' instead of 'Why do I suffer?' Surely, we are losing our minds and our humanity. Elio Frattaroli is a wise, funny, and inspiring advisor who, as a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, clearly shows us the risks we are taking, as well as the solutions available through our own insights." (Polly Young-Eisendrath, Ph.D., Author of <i>The Resilient Spirit</i> and <i>Women and Desire</i>) <br><br> "This superb new book is a much-needed wake-up call. Frattaroli reminds us that there is a person behind the symptoms-a human spirit yearning to be known and understood." (Glen O. Gabbard, M. D., Professor of Psychiatry, Baylor College of Medicine)</i>Elio Frattaroli, M.D., is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in full time private practice. He is on the faculty of the Psychoanalytic Center of Philadelphia and is also an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.

Patterns capture many of the best practices of software design, making them available to all software engineers. The fourth volume in a series of books documenting patterns for professional software developers, Pattern Languages of Program Design 4 represents the current and state-of-the-art practices in the patterns community. The 29 chapters of this book were each presented at recent PLoP conferences and have been explored and enhanced by leading experts in attendance. Representing the best of the conferences, these patterns provide effective, tested, and versatile software design solutions for solving real-world problems in a variety of domains. This book covers a wide range of topics, with patterns in the areas of object-oriented infrastructure, programming strategies, temporal patterns, security, domain-oriented patterns, human-computer interaction, reviewing, and software management.Among them, you will find: *The Role object *Proactor *C++ idioms *Architectural patterns for security *Reports *Composing multimedia artifacts *Customer interaction As patterns evolve beyond the realm of research into the world of practical software development, more and more developers are discovering that reusable design patterns (such as those contained in this volume) can help them achieve faster, more cost-effective delivery of their applications. 0201433044B04062001</p><p>Software patterns are reusable, higher-order designs that recur repeatedly across applications. <i>Pattern Languages of Program Design 4</i> offers a wide variety of these forms from different areas of computing. Especially valuable to C++ or Java programmers, but useful to anyone who designs software for a living, this book is a worthy choice containing dozens of designs that you can incorporate into your own projects.<p> Arranged in 23 chapters, each containing multiple patterns, the text contains well over 100 software setups on a wide variety of topics. Standout sections here include a compilation of C++ idioms by James Coplien, which are derived from his well-known <i>Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms</i>, a book that helped inspire early pattern-makers. A chapter on managing limited memory provides tips for working with embedded systems on today's handheld devices. Those with a background in engineering will also appreciate the catalog of patterns for finite state machines (FSMs).</p><p> Designers have the tendency to make patterns out of what is familiar to most everyone. Several chapters look at patterns used on Web sites (for example, navigation bars) and in wiring together multimedia content. The book also groups management patterns, some of which can be used for improving customer relations and managing software development. The last section, surely the most entertaining, is devoted to software management and describes why most code, over time, devolves into a "Big Ball of Mud."</p><p> There is certainly a lot to take away for any designer who reads this book. It is a particularly rich collection of recently "discovered" patterns that will get you thinking about reusable design in your own software. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: Object-oriented software design patterns, C++ idioms, patterns for managing limited memory, patterns for Smalltalk prototyping, patterns for history and time, security patterns, report patterns, feature extraction patterns, finite state machine (FSM) patterns, patterns for Web sites and multimedia systems, patterns for reusable multimedia artifacts, patterns for telecommunications, patterns for choosing publishable papers for conferences, patterns from writers' workshops, customer interaction patterns, patterns for better software project management.</p>Of Phish and Phugues <p> The year is 1621; the place, Plymouth, in what will eventually become Massachusetts. A group of settlers from England arrived the previous November and are now setting out to plant crops. Before long a native named Squanto stops by. Evidently a gardening enthusiast, he offers to tutor the settlers in farming techniques, first by placing fish in the ground to enrich the soil. This and other tricks of farming in the New World contribute to a bountiful harvest. The settlers survive the ensuing winter, thanks in large part to Squanto and his sage advice. </p><p> An apocryphal story, no doubt, but modern horticulturists can corroborate Squanto's fishy insights. In fact, you can buy fish fertilizers in many gardening stores. Our agricultural forebears may not have had a deep knowledge of plant physiology, but they knew what worked. And they passed it along. </p><p> Over a hundred years later and half a world away, in what is now Germany, a master of a different sort plies his trade. According to legend, Johann Sebastian Bach pays a visit to Frederick the Great, King of Prussia. After exchanging pleasantries, the king asks Bach to play something for him. Dutifully and without hesitation, Bach sits down at the organ and improvises a five-part fugue. The king, an eminent composer himself, is awed. </p><p> Bach's work is the very essence of baroque music. And he passes that mastery along--several of his children also become important musicians and composers. </p><p> Lore flows from one generation to the next. Languages are vivid examples, perpetuating and evolving through oral tradition--words and concepts passing from person to person. A case in point is English, which traces its roots to numerous languages, including German, Greek, and Latin. Herein lies a problem: the multifaceted heritage of English creates a potpourri of spelling conventions that is downright bewildering. For example, we spell the "f" sound with the letters "ph" in "physics" but with "f" in "fish" and "fugue." There are historical and linguistic reasons for such anomalies, but they don't matter much to us. We just memorize that it's "fugue," not "phugue." </p><p> In software we don't have centuries of history to draw on. We didn't learn agriculture from ancient farmers, nor can we trace our roots through the Middle English of Chaucer. But we have been around long enough to learn a few things. The most important among them is this: We must share what we have learned. If we keep knowledge to ourselves, hoarding it like pack rats, then our field will surely stagnate. We doom colleague and successor alike to repeat our mistakes. Gradually, reinvention displaces innovation. Progress slows. The field goes fallow. </p><p> Patterns are conduits of knowledge, capturing and conveying time-proven practices. Patterns are more than tricks or seemingly arbitrary spelling rules--they impart understanding. They teach you not just what and how but also why and when. That's where their real power lies. </p><p> What can we reasonably expect of patterns? Maybe they will help other people develop better software than we have. Maybe they'll allow people to build on what we've done right. We certainly hope patterns will help others avoid the pitfalls we've experienced. </p><p> But we can expect more. The pervasiveness of computer technology exerts a strong influence on society. Influence of such magnitude must be exercised responsibly. While patterns won't force you to act responsibly, they can ease the grind of reinvention, freeing you to consider higher purposes. Ultimately, patterns make life better for everyone--software user and developer alike. </p><p> These are ambitious and humbling goals, to be sure. We dedicate this fourth volume in the Pattern Languages of Program Design series to their attainment. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </p><p> Now for a word about the contributors to this book.

To the authors, self-hypnosis is an ideal way to reach a state of relaxation and concentration that will allow you to send healing messages to your body and really get it to listen. The easy-to-follow text includes several methods of hypnotic induction, and instructs readers on using the process to lose weight, sleep better, overcome depression, improve their sex lives, slow the aging process, and conquer other health difficulties that are now widely acknowledged to depend quite a bit on subconscious mental states. The authors acknowledge that hypnosis is often misunderstood, and they devote quite a bit of effort to overcoming misconceptions and getting readers to take it seriously as a healing force. --Ben Kallen, Personal Growth editorDr. Caroline Miller is the Dean of Academic Studies at the American Institute of Hypnotherapy in Irvine, California.

Griffiths is just a Midwest kid, the son of a preacher in Kansas City, who tastes a little sophistication and then hits the road seeking pleasure and success. He has his moments, conducting more than one romantic affair, until that ill-advised pursuit ensnares him. Then he reads about an "accident" of a young woman and ponders a dastardly deed ... Dreiser spins these scenes with the eye of a master in control of his form. <i>An American Tragedy</i> stands as an American masterpiece.Theodore Dreiser (1871&#x2013;1945) was an American author and an outstanding representative of naturalism, whose novels depict real-life subjects in a harsh light. Dreiser's novels, particularly Sister Carrie, were held to be amoral, and he battled throughout his career against censorship and popular taste.<br><br>Dan John Miller has earned multiple Audie Award nominations, winning for The Wrecking Crew by Kent Hartman; has twice been named a Best Voice by AudioFile magazine; and has received several AudioFile Earphones Awards.</p><h2>Native Visions: Evolution in Northwest Coast Art from the Eighteenth Through the Twentieth Century</h2><p>Masks, bowls, bentwood boxes, and weavings from Native artists of the Northwest Coast grace museums around the world. Northwest Coast art has always been a changing and evolving tradition, as is evidenced by the varieties of style visible in artifacts collected from the area over the last two centuries. This richly informative book includes photographs of more than 160 objects from Seattle-area private collections and the Seattle Art Museum, grouped chronologically to illustrate evolutionary changes within the Northwest Coast art tradition. Not a static, rigid, or impersonal tradition, Northwest Coast art is stretched and remolded anew by individuals in each generation. This is a tradition of great antiquity which remain vital and alive today in the work of the best contemporary Northwest Coast Native Artists.<p>Many pieces by the 19th-century artists Charles Edenshaw, masks and totem pole models by Willie Seaweed, and unusual gold sculpture by Bill Reid are among the extraordinary artworks included in <i>Native Visions.</i></p><p>Steven C. Brown approaches Northwest Coast art as a highly flexible and varied tradition, driven and molded by individual Native artists. In prose that is lively, lucid, and refreshingly free of jargon, he illustrates the means by which the styles and contributions of individual artists have served to evolve the tradition. His application of classic art-historical models of the American art traditions to Northwest Coast art reveals the role played by the inspirations and motivations of these artists in shaping the progressive development of this fascinating art form Paul Macapia's magnificent color photographs include images of rare and previously unpublished examples of Northwest Coast art. The book is based on an exhibition organized by the Seattle Art Museum and traveling to Anchorage, Indianapolis, and Cooperstown, New York.</p></p><p>Steven C. Brown is associate curator of Native American art at the Seattle Art Museum.Sparkling with over 200 illustrations, 100 of them in color, of the magnificent art of Northwest Coast Native Americans, this book accompanies a traveling exhibition that originated at the Seattle Art Museum. Brown, associate curator of Native American art for the museum, is particularly interested in examining the chronology shown by changes in design forms. He traces the development of the consistent, dramatic style from the prehistoric era through the classic early 19th-century two-dimensional style to the current revival using variations on old themes. His emphasis on details of variation in design makes the text somewhat pedantic; he doesn't define much-used terms like formline and negative space, and he presupposes some knowledge of the culture's history, tribal customs, and mythology. But the art is breathtaking. For college or art libraries or those with collections of Native American materials.?Gay Neale, Southside Virginia Community Coll.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his A-team were present. It soon became clear that the main item on the menu was Libya, where it was alleged that the forces of Muammar Gaddafi were advancing on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi to crush all opposition. Over an $80 per head lunch, a small group of the world&#39;s most important diplomats from countries represented on the Security Council discussed the possibility of the use of force. As things turned out, the Council&#39;s authorization came only ten days later, and all hell broke loose. Hardeep Singh Puri, India&#39;s envoy to the UN at the time, now reveals the Council&#39;s whimsical decision making and the ill-thought-out itch to intervene on the part of some of its permanent members. Perilous Interventions shows how some recent instances of the use of force - not just in Libya but also in Syria, Yemen and Crimea, as well as India&#39;s misadventure in Sri Lanka in the 1980s - have gone disastrously wrong.</p><p>Hardeep Singh Puri is a former Indian Foreign Service officer who served as the Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations in Geneva from 2002 to 2005 and in New York from 2009 to 2013, coinciding with the period in 2011-12 when India was a non-permanent member of the Security Council. He was president of the Council in August 2011 and November 2012.&#x2018;Ambassador Hardeep Puri&#x2019;s book has uniqueness for being an insider&#x2019;s account, which adds to our understanding of the inner mechanisms of an institution that has at times been called a modern-day Star Chamber.&#x2019; &#x2013; Hamid Ansari, Vice President of India, releasing the book<br><br>&#x2018;The explosive narration unveils the whimsical decision-making behind bids to maintain international peace and security.&#x2019; &#x2013; Crissie Delvy, Indian American Times <br><br>&#x2018;Throwing some light and plenty of fresh insight into a tangled web of misjudged decisions by the West is Hardeep Singh Puri, who was one of India&#x2019;s outstanding plenipotentiaries in important global capitals. Puri rips the veil of faux altruism of these &#x201c;high-end decision-making, often over $80 per head lunch&#x201d; and talks of how a small group of the world&#x2019;s most empowered diplomats represented on the Security Council discuss the use of force on other nations to effect regime change and how this &#x201c;ill-thought out itch&#x201d; to intervene results in disastrous consequence for the country, the region and the world. Puri&#x2019;s conclusions are devastating in their forthrightness and he says categorically that ill-advised military interventions are not the answer to poor governance whose ideological underpinnings may not be in sync with Western philosophies.&#x2019; &#x2013; Tarun Basu, Business Standard <br><br>&#x2018;[T]he book&#x2019;s anecdotes on how diplomacy is made to work at the UN under seemingly hopeless circumstances are applicable to domestic political discourse.

(Travis Workman, author of <i>Imperial Genus: The Formation and Limits of the Human in Modern Korea and Japan</i>)<br><br>The earliest work by one of Japan&#x2019;s foremost writers to appear in English, <i>Beasts Head for Home</i> tells the story of a young Japanese man who undertakes a harrowing journey in an attempt to reach Japan after the collapse of the Japanese Empire. The story is particularly affecting to read in this historical moment with so much forced migration all over the world. Calichman&#x2019;s translation is flawless. (J. Keith Vincent, translator of <i>Devils in Daylight</i> by Junichiro Tanizaki)<br><br>Calichman&#x2019;s superb translation of Abe&#x2019;s semiautobiographical novel brings us a Kafkaesque world of displacement where settlers of Manchuria undergo the loss of home, identity, and belonging after the collapse of the Japanese empire. <i>Beasts Head for Home</i> is a haunting and gripping story and an indispensable read for anyone interested in postcolonial studies, settler colonial studies, and the history of empire. (Katsuya Hirano, author of <i>The Politics of Dialogic Imagination: Power and Popular Culture in Early Modern Japan </i>)<br><br>With subtle echoes of a samurai classic, Abe&#x2019;s autobiographical novel is a memorable portrait of statelessness, exile, and wandering. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>This novel is an excellent entry point into Abe&#x2019;s writing, with much of his signature tone and style. He is a master of controlling the reader&#x2019;s emotional investment while crafting an increasingly suffocating atmosphere of dread, resulting in a devastating reading experience. (<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i>)<br><br>In a time when the world is increasingly faced with an obsession with borders and anxieties regarding what is called the "refugee crisis," this timely new translation of Kobo Abe's novel provides a necessary coming to terms with the experience of the ravages of war on the displaced. . . . Abe exposes the very fluidity with which our sense of belongingness, even ownership, must continually be tested and reckoned with. (Lawrence Lacambra Ypil <i>Cha: An Asian Literary Journal</i>)<br><br>An excellent introduction to Abe&#x2019;s work. (<i>Tony's Reading List</i>)<br><br><i>Beasts Head for Home</i> is as riveting and as unforgiving as the frigid Civil War wilderness in which it is set. (Peter Gordon <i>Asian Review of Books</i>)<br><br>With its historical setting and named characters, <i>Beasts Head for Home</i> diverges from the surreal landscape of Abe's best-known work, <i>The Woman in the Dunes</i>, but alienation is at the Kafkaesque heart of both novels. Though Kyuzo somehow manages to complete his physical journey, he remains an exile, unable even to define the home he seeks. . . . The howling misery of his displacement circa 1947 resonates powerfully with the headlines of 2017: a grim story of the past for our grim present. (Janice P. Nimura <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>This early work of acclaimed Japanese writer Abe is finally available in English, and Calichman&#x2019;s adroit translation also provides an essential context-establishing introduction. Abe&#x2019;s novel is testimony to survival despite gruesome odds as well as a chilling warning about the cost to humanity of such struggles.

The animal feeding and nutrition industries are as computerized as any industry in the world, but the challenge has been to find software that can effectively accompany a book and give the reader everything they need to succeed. This is a deficiency that has now been addressed. The ration formulation software has the same functionality as that used in the industry today and covers each species discussed in the book. Along with the software, the book includes the most current information on animal feeding and nutrition available, including full species coverage such as four ruminants, swine, chickens, rabbits, horses, dogs, cats, trout, and catfish. The book also extensively covers dietary energy, water requirements for livestock, and feed milling.</p><p>David Tisch � Professor at SUNY Cobleskill�s Department of Animal Science.

It is also a world of boomtowns and bars, oil rigs and seismic soundings; of white energy speculators, ranchers, and sports hunters. Brody came to this dual world with the job of "mapping" the lands of northwest British Columbia as well as the way of life of a small group of Beaver Indians with a viable hunting economy living in the path of a projected oil pipeline. The result is Maps and Dreams, Brody's account of his extraordinary eighteen-month journey through the world of a people who have no intention of vanishing into the past. In this beautifully written book, readers go on a moose hunt; trap beaver; mourn at a funeral; drink in white bars; visit camps, cabins, and traplines by pickup truck, on horseback, and on foot. Brody's powerful commentary also retraces the history of the ever-expanding white frontier from the first eighteenth-century explorer to the wildest corporate energy dreams of the present day. In the process, readers see how Indian dreams and white dreams, Indians maps and white maps, collide.<p> Titles of related interest available from Waveland Press: Balikci, <i>The Netsilik Eskimo</i> (ISBN 9780881334357); Jarvenpa, <i>Northern Passage: Ethnography and Apprenticeship among the Subarctic Dene</i> (ISBN 9780881339901); Kawagley, <i>A Yupiaq Worldview: A Pathway to Ecology and Spirit,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781577663843); and Ziker, <i>Peoples of the Tundra: Northern Siberians in the Post-Communist Transition</i> (ISBN 9781577662129).</p></p><p>Hugh Brody is a writer, anthropologist and filmmaker.

Eminent Supreme Court scholar Lawrence Baum argues that the links between ideology and issues are not simply a matter of reasoning logically from general premises. Rather, they reflect the development of shared understandings among political elites, including Supreme Court justices. And broad values about matters such as equality are not the only source of these understandings. Another potentially important source is the justices' attitudes about social or political groups, such as the business community and the Republican and Democratic parties.</p><p>The book probes these sources by analyzing three issues on which the relative positions of liberal and conservative justices changed between 1910 and 2013: freedom of expression, criminal justice, and government "takings" of property. Analyzing the Court's decisions and other developments during that period, Baum finds that the values underlying liberalism and conservatism help to explain these changes, but that justices' attitudes toward social and political groups also played a powerful role.</p><p>Providing a new perspective on how ideology functions in Supreme Court decision making, <i>Ideology in the Supreme Court</i> has important implications for how we think about the Court and its justices.</p></p><p><p>"It is common, and surely correct, to note that Supreme Court justices often vote ideologically. It is also common, and also surely correct, to note that it is not as simple as that. Baum takes this as a starting point to explore just how--in a world in which ideological coalitions shape so many things--ideology permeates judicial decision making."<b>--Hans Noel, author of <i>Political Ideologies and Political Parties in America</i></b></p><p>"Very good scholars answer important questions that no one has answered before. Truly great scholars answer questions that no one has asked before. Such is the case with Lawrence Baum's <i>Ideology in the Supreme Court</i>. Using a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods, Baum has written a thought-provoking book that clearly demonstrates that ideological polarity does not flow only from logical premises, but rather that, consistent with psychological theories of human behavior, group affect plays a substantial role."<b>--&#x2014;Jeffrey A. Segal, Stony Brook University</b></p><p>"Close observers of the Supreme Court know that sometimes its conservatives and liberals flip sides. Using the examples of free speech, criminal law, and takings, with glances at other topics, Lawrence Baum develops a systematic account of why and how these shifts occur. In doing so, he deepens our understanding of how ideology--apart from political theories and preferences about outcomes--shapes the Court's decisions."<b>--Mark Tushnet, Harvard Law School</b></p><p>"Baum offers a unique perspective on the Supreme Court. He makes a compelling case for reconsidering our traditional understanding of ideological voting on the Court, suggesting that justices' votes may be determined by their disposition toward particular litigants. Presenting a challenging new way to think about decision making on the Court, this is an important book."<b>--Kevin T.

Dr Richardson&#39;s claim is that this was not a simple development, as it is usually conceived to be, but one which took place over a long period. The equation between the Church and the &#39;true Israel&#39; does not occur, Dr Richardson argues, until the mid-second century in the works of Justin Martyr. The book is concerned mainly with an exegetical study of the New Testament passages relevant to the argument, concentrating on the Pauline epistles. There are other sections on the attitude of Jesus himself towards Israel, on post-Pauline developments, on political factors and on the early Fathers to A.D. I6o. The book ends with a synthesis of conclusions, and there are appendixes on the Sects of Judaism, Paul&#39;s Use of Laos and the Apology of Aristides. This comprehensive analysis of a vital problem in the early Church&#39;s life and witness has many important implications for a theology of the Church.</p><p>This historical study is concerned with the adoption by Christianity of Jewish prerogatives and attributes, and in particular with its assumption of the name &#39;Israel&#39;.

This choice collection presents readers with original translations of five of the great French writer's most acclaimed stories.<br>In "The Unknown Masterpiece," a tale much admired by C�zanne and Picasso, a painter becomes obsessed with his search for utter perfection. In its masterly examination of the conflict between an artist's commitment to his work and his obligations to others, the story involves a theme particularly close to Balzac's heart. Two of the other stories explore the consequences of the quest for worldly wealth. Written in 1830 but set in France's Revolutionary period, "An Episode During the Terror" moves from a suspenseful beginning to a solemn tableau that contrasts material poverty with spiritual riches; in "Facino Cane" an old and destitute blind man recounts how his passion for gold led to his fall from grace. Included also are "The Revolutionary Conscript" and "A Passion in the Desert."<br>In their bold, distinctive portraits of French society during the 19th century, these tales offer a perfect introduction for readers unfamiliar with Balzac's work. This modestly priced edition will also appeal to those already acquainted with the author's much-imitated but unsurpassed style.</p><p></p></p><p>Honor� De Balzac (1799-1850) is generally credited as the inventor of the modern realistic novel.

They hosted Saturday evening salons at which the brightest artists, writers, musicians, and collectors convened to discuss the latest developments. They aggressively promoted and collected emerging painters and sculptors, particularly their close friends Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. And along the way they developed unparalleled holdings in modernist work by such figures as Paul C�zanne, Juan Gris, Francis Picabia, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Lavishly produced and featuring more than 600 images, <i>The Steins Collect</i> is the first comprehensive exploration of the Steins' extraordinary collections and their enduring cultural influence.</p><p>The book explores the Steins' impact on art-making and collecting practices in Europe and the United States; the intense sibling rivalries that developed around key artists and ideas; the roots of Leo's aesthetic theories in the thought of William James and Bernard Berenson; Sarah and Michael's role in founding the Acad�mie Matisse; Gertrude's complex relationship with Picasso and their artistic influence on each other; Le Corbusier's radical villa design for the family; and much more. <i>The Steins Collect</i> not only reveals the artistic prescience of this innovative family and their important patronage, but also traces how they created a new international standard of taste for modern art.</p></p><p><b>Janet Bishop</b> is curator of painting and sculpture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. <b>C�cile Debray</b> is curator of historical collections at the Muse� National d'Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris. <b>Rebecca Rabinow</b> is associate curator of 19th-century, modern, and contemporary art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.&nbsp; <b>Robert McD.

Thomas Jefferson, infuriated by these claims, brought a seven-foot-tall carcass of a moose from America to the entry hall of his Parisian hotel, but the five-foot-tall Buffon remained unimpressed and refused to change his views on America's inferiority.<br><br>Buffon, as Philippe Roger demonstrates here, was just one of the first in a long line of Frenchmen who have built a history of anti-Americanism in that country, a progressive history that is alternately ludicrous and trenchant. <i>The American Enemy</i> is Roger's bestselling and widely acclaimed history of French anti-Americanism, presented here in English translation for the first time. <br><br>With elegance and good humor, Roger goes back 200 years to unearth the deep roots of this anti-Americanism and trace its changing nature, from the belittling, as Buffon did, of the "savage American" to France's resigned dependency on America for goods and commerce and finally to the fear of America's global domination in light of France's thwarted imperial ambitions. Roger sees French anti-Americanism as barely acquainted with actual fact; rather, anti-Americanism is a cultural pillar for the French, America an idea that the country and its culture have long defined themselves against. <br><br>Sharon Bowman's fine translation of this magisterial work brings French anti-Americanism into the broad light of day, offering fascinating reading for Americans who care about our image abroad and how it came about. <br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Roger almost single-handedly creates a new field of study, tracing the nuances and imagery of anti-Americanism in France over 250 years. He shows that far from being a specific reaction to recent American policies, it has been knit into the very substance of French intellectual and cultural life. . . .

Roger&#x2014;a professor at the Sorbonne&#x2014;has assembled a gallery of all the negative commonplaces, stereotypes and cliches about the United States: bad climate, savage natives, Indian-killers, slavedrivers, robber barons, capitalist fat cats, unlivable cities, soulless scientists, etc. The caricatures are occasionally drawn by some of France's finest pens, and they get our attention.

This enlisting of the nexus of love and hate, of slavery to opposing passions, is an exhilarating way of launching a study of attitudes, of liberating the atavism of animosities from the contingencies of events and circumstances. Roger argues that the roots of French anti-Americanism lie in the doubts of Enlightenment science that the New World was a viable one at all."--Bill Grantham, <i>World Policy Journal</i><br> (Bill Grantham <i>World Policy Journal</i> 2003-06-01)<br><br>"A brilliant and exhaustive guide to the history of French Ameriphobia."&#x2014;Simon Schama, <i>New Yorker<br></i> (Simon Schama <i>New Yorker</i> 2003-03-10)<br><br>"Roger concentrates on one country--France--and takes the long, historical view. French anti-Americanism, he shows in <i>The American Enemy</i>, goes back to the eighteenth century. . . . Anti-Americanism goes back a long way, and Philippe Roger does an impressive job of unravelling its various strands and tracing their ancestry."--Henri Astier, <i>Times Literary Supplement<br></i> (Henri Astier <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2003-01-10)<br><br>"Philippe Roger has written a superb history of French anti-Americanism, elegant, learned, witty. This enjoyable exercise, in the very best traditions of French scholarship, richly deserves to be published in English translation, unabridged. The book's argument is far too subtle and intricate to summarize briefly, but the word "genealogy" in the title should be taken seriously. . . . In nearly six hundred pages of close textual exegesis, Roger demonstrates not only that the core of French anti-Americanism is very old indeed, but also that it was always fanciful, only loosely attached to American reality."&#x2014;Tony Judt, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br> (Tony Judt <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2003-05-01)<br><br>"Mr. Roger almost single-handedly creates a new field of study, tracing the nuances and imagery of anti-Americanism in France over 250 years.

A bible for students of anti-Americanism."--<i>Economist</i><br> (<i>The Economist</i> 2005-04-16)<br><br>"Here is a tasty statistic: when the US went into Iraq a survey showed that America's popularity plunged everywhere--except in France. The French opposed the invasion vehemently, but the country was already so saturated in anti-Americanism that the index scarcely flickered. Which makes Philippe Roger a brave and lonely man. His book is that seemingly impossible thing: an attack on French Americophobia written by a Frenchman. For, as he demonstrates in this scholarly yet highly entertaining work, the French allergy to all things American is a national psychosis which today tells us more about the condition of France than it does about the United States. . . . For all its amusing vignettes, Philippe Roger's message is sober, and a foreword asks an excellent question: how far is the demonising of America, not just in France but the world over, helping to convert a war of words into a more fearsome conflict?"--George Walden, <i>Sunday Telegraph</i><br> (George Walden <i>Sunday Telegraph (London)</i> 2005-03-27)<br><br>"The dangers of clumsy translations and cultural misunderstandings are central to the arguments Philippe Roger makes in his timely and wise book. Roger sets out to show that French anti-Americanism has been less a product of genuine antagonism than the result of a series of misunderstandings. To Roger's dismay, these misunderstandings&#x2014;sometimes wilful, but often based on genuine confusion&#x2014;have come to play a central role in French identity. . . . <i>The American Enemy</i> is a shrewd and deft analysis of French cultural history which unmasks a great many absurdities, past and present." (Andrew Hussey <i>New Statesman</i> 2005-04-18)<br><br>"In this fascinating history, noted French historian and cultural critic Roger wittily documents French anti-Americanism from the Enlightenment through McDonald's invasion of French cuisine. Part of Roger's analytic technique is uncovering obscure but intriguing historical information&#x2014;e.g., early anti-American sentiments were based on the supposedly scientific argument that the Americas were filled with poisonous substances and sickly animals. While such tidbits are entertaining, the book quickly demonstrates how, during the 20th century, France's anti-American attitudes deepened as the U.S. become a world power, overshadowing the traditional European empires. This shift helped create a cultural container for all anti-American feelings including mistrust of Ford's assembly line, moral abhorrence of a growing world economy controlled by the U.S. and distaste for American customs and personalities. . . .

Beginning with the 1960s, Seidman shows how both authoritarian states promoted specific rapid-industrialization strategies, in the process reshaping the working class and altering relationships between business and the state. When economic growth slowed in the 1970s, workers in these countries challenged social and political repression; by the mid-1980s, they had become major voices in the transition from authoritarian rule.<br><br>Based in factories and working-class communities, these movements enjoyed broad support as they fought for improved social services, land reform, expanding electoral participation, and racial integration.<br><br>In Brazil, Seidman takes us from the shopfloor, where disenfranchized workers organized for better wages and working conditions, to the strikes and protests that spread to local communities. Similar demands for radical change emerged in South Africa, where community groups in black townships joined organized labor in a challenge to minority rule that linked class consciousness to racial oppression. Seidman details the complex dynamics of these militant movements and develops a broad analysis of how newly industrializing countries shape the opportunities for labor to express demands. Her work will be welcomed by those interested in labor studies, social theory, and the politics of newly industrializing regions.</p><p><b>Gay Seidman</b> is Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.</p><h2>Training For Dummies</h2><p>Millions of Americans have to train others as part of their jobs.

This is a primary document of enormous importance for all Wagner enthusiasts, being virtually the sole source of information of the composer&#39;s childhood and youth. Written for Wagner&#39;s second wife, Cosima, and his patron, King Ludwig II, the autobiography runs from the composer&#39;s birth up to the eve of his fifty-first birthday in 1864. Given the intended readership and the circumstances of its composition it is hardly surprising that Wagner should either omit or distort facts from time to time: he does not linger over previous affairs, he portrays his relationship with his first wife, Minna, as a good deal more distant than it really was and he plays down his involvement in the Dresden uprising of 1849. Despite all this, the book presents a panoramic view of Wagner&#39;s times and contemporaries and offers a unique perspective on the operas themselves. This translation is of the complete edition published in Munich in 1963 and based on the manuscript in the Wagner Archives in Bayreuth. Wagner&#39;s slips of memory are noted, as are references to obscure names and events.</p><p>This reprint is of the first English paperback edition of Richard Wagner&#39;s autobiography. This is a primary document of enormous importance for all Wagner enthusiasts, being virtually the sole source of information of the composer&#39;s childhood and youth.Wilhelm Richard Wagner (22 May 1813 &#x2013; 13 February 1883) was a German composer, theatre director, polemicist, and conductor who is primarily known for his operas (or, as some of his later works were later known, "music dramas"). Unlike most opera composers, Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works. Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Weber and Meyerbeer, Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk ("total work of art"), by which he sought to synthesise the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts, with music subsidiary to drama, and which was announced in a series of essays between 1849 and 1852. Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera cycle "Der Ring des Nibelungen" (The Ring of the Nibelung). His compositions, particularly those of his later period, are notable for their complex textures, rich harmonies and orchestration, and the elaborate use of leitmotifs&#x2014;musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas or plot elements. His advances in musical language, such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres, greatly influenced the development of classical music. His "Tristan und Isolde" is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music.</p><h2>Ceremonias (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>A selection of the Argentinian writer&#39;s finest short stories encompasses work originally published in Final del juego and Las armas secretas</p><p></p><h2>Fundraising Principles and Practice</h2><p>This books offers a definitive text on the vital topic fundraising.

Curiously, little is known about his private life or opinions, as his works (celebratory odes, plays, didactic prose, etc.) betray little of the private man. Winn's ambitious biography draws together what is known about Dryden's life from public records, reminiscences of friends and contemporaries, and sparse revelations in the works. Other good biographies have been published, but few have captured Dryden's era so well. Winn's scholarship is excellent, and the book is augmented by detailed notes and documentation to encourage further study. Unfortunately, Winn is no stylist, and the book can be dry and somewhat dull; nevertheless, highly recommended for all academic libraries. James Stephenson, George Washington Univ.

When we fully realize the potential of specific interventions to help clients arrive at certain outcomes, then we can choose these interventions and techniques with greater skill and confidence.<br> <br>Systematic application, however, depends on a number of key factors to succeed. First, every profession benefits from the application of evidence and theory to their practice. Evidence<br>based practice; i.e., the application of research evidence to intervention design, and theory-based practice;i.e., the application of relevant theory to intervention design, are both equally important to ensure that programs, interventions , or treatments are built on best practices. Conversely, programs that are designed haphazardly or lackadaisically - say from tradition, therapist interest, or sheer inertia - are unlikely to help clients to achieve their goals and fulfill their full potential.<br>Second, program design and planning needs to be done with care and through a systematic<br>process using established procedures. Comprehensive program design, activity analysis, protocol development, are a few of the <br>steps of systematic program design used by therapeutic recreation specialists. Third, targeting important and valued client outcomes<br>is extremely important. Clients and their families need to be assured that professionals are providing the best possible care, in the most efficient and effective manner possible, to arrive at the most vital and significant outcomes.<br><br>The aim of this book is to vastly improve our frameworks for interventions by extracting and synthesizing the best possible evidence and theory so that therapists can then apply systematic program design and build effective and meaningful programs aimed at specific and known outcomes. Each chapter contains introductory information, followed by research evidence to support the technique, and related studies in the therapeutic recreation literature. A sampling of resources and illustrative activities are included in most chapters as well. This book provides students and practitioners with solid information that will improve the likelihood that the interventions they provide are the most powerful and most effective.</p><p></p><h2>Ante Pacem: Archaeological Evidence of Church Life Before Constantine</h2><p>Much new information on early Christian archaeology has emerged during the last 100 years, prompting a sweeping reinterpretation of past evidence. However, before the publication of Ante Pacem: Archaeological Evidence of Church life before Constantine, there was no introduction or source book for early Christian archaeology available in English. With this book, Graydon Snyder has performed an incalculable service for all who are interested in the life and worship practices of the earliest Christian church. The church after Constantine was filled with ritual and expressed many of the traditions and practices of the pagan religions it supplanted. But what was church life like from A.D. 100 to A.D. 300? It is usually viewed as similar to church life as it was known after Constantine. But is this a correct view? Ante Pacem challenges a concept of second-and third-century church life that has prevailed for more than 400 years. This book has all the ingredients to foster a totally new understanding of the early Christians. If Snyder is correct-and his marshaling of the evidence is compelling-then the whole idea of a ritualistic church will have to undergo serious reconsideration. Lucid, scholarly, and thorough, Ante Pacem may just prove to one of the most influential books of our time. It is a work that must either be accepted, with all its implications, or must be answered with scholarship as thorough as Dr. Snyder&#39;s.</p><p></p><h2>The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre (Cambridge Companions to Literature)</h2><p>The mystery plays and other drama of the English Middle Ages are perennially popular with students and theater audiences alike.

There are few undergraduate or graduate courses in which it does not form a core component. Game theory is the study of multi-decision problems and such problems occur frequently in economics. Industrial organization provides many examples where firms must consider the reactions of others. But there are many other areas in which it is applicable - from individual workers vying for promotion to countries competing or colluding to choose trade policies. Bob Gibbons provides an introduction to the branches of game theory that have been widely applied in economics. He emphasizes the applications as much as the pure theory. This not only helps to teach the theory, but also illustrates the process of model building - the process of translating an informal description of a multi-person decision situation into a formal, game theoretic problem to be analyzed. The approach aims to serve as both an introduction to those who will go on to specialize as pure game-theorists. It also introduces game theory to those who will later construct (or at least use) game-theoretic models in applied fields of economics.</p><p></p><h2>Erlang and OTP in Action</h2><p><p>Concurrent programming has become a required discipline for all programmers.

The chief danger that early Christianity had to face came from the heretical Dualist sect founded in the mid-third century AD by the prophet Mani. Within a century of his death Manichaean churches were established from western Mediterranean lands to eastern Turkestan. Though Manichaeism failed in the end to supplant orthodox Christianity, the Church had been badly frightened; and henceforth it gave the hated epithet of &#39;Manichaean&#39; to the churches of Dualist doctrines that survived into the late Middle Ages.</p><p></p><h2>Goblin Market</h2><p>One hundred years ago, Rossetti was Britain&#39;s most popular poet, described by Virginia Woolf as &#34;the first of our English Poetesses&#34;. &#39;Goblin Market&#39; is her best-known poem.</p><p>Christina Georgina Rossetti was part of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, along with her brothers Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William M.

Many saw America as a New Israel, a modern nation chosen to do God's work on Earth, and produced a rich variety of inspirational art and literature about their travels in the original promised land, which was then part of Ottoman-controlled Palestine. In <i>American Palestine</i>, Hilton Obenzinger explores two "infidel texts" in this tradition: Herman Melville's <i>Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage to the Holy Land</i> (1876) and Mark Twain's <i>The Innocents Abroad: or, The New Pilgrims' Progress</i> (1869). As he shows, these works undermined in very different ways conventional assumptions about America's divine mission.</p><br><p> In the darkly philosophical <i>Clarel</i>, Melville found echoes of Palestine's apparent desolation and ruin in his own spiritual doubts and in America's materialism and corruption. Twain's satiric travelogue, by contrast, mocked the romantic naivet� of Americans abroad, noting the incongruity of a "fantastic mob" of "Yanks" in the Holy Land and contrasting their exalted notions of Palestine with its prosaic reality. Obenzinger demonstrates, however, that Melville and Twain nevertheless shared many colonialist and orientalist assumptions of the day, revealed most clearly in their ideas about Arabs, Jews, and Native Americans.</p><br><p> Combining keen literary and historical insights and careful attention to the context of other American writings about Palestine, this book throws new light on the construction of American identity in the nineteenth century.</p></p><p><p>"Obenzinger writes with insight, authority, and great thoroughness. And his historical backgrounding is consistently interesting, entertaining, and instructive. American Palestine contains one of the most searching critiques I know of the complexities of dissent in Melville's work. There is no better survey of Americans abroad in the Gilded Age and no sharper analysis of the West-as-metaphor in Twain's work. American Palestine is a distinguished contribution to American literary and cultural studies."--<b>Sacvan Bercovitch, Charles H. Carswell Professor of English and American Literature, Harvard University</b></p> <p>"American Palestine is a study of the way that the cultural obsession with 'Palestine' helped to define America's settler-colonial identity both before and after the Civil War and thus kept alive its own expansionist energies. Obenzinger turns an extraordinarily improbable, not to say problematic, comparison and contrast between Melville and Twain into a splendid examination of the nineteenth-century American metaphysics of Holy Land-loving."--<b>Giles Gunn, University of California, Santa Barbara</b></p><b>Hilton Obenzinger</b> is a critic, novelist, and poet.

The authors expose the bureaucracy and stagnation that mark discipline without agility, and liken agility without discipline to unbridled and fruitless enthusiasm. Using a day in the life of two development teams and ground-breaking case studies, they illustrate the differences and similarities between agile and plan-driven methods, and show that the best development strategies have ways to combine both attributes.

First published in Stevenson's classic collection <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i> in 1883, this timeless poem about imaginative play gets its own lively picture book here, centering on a contemporary boy who uses his building blocks to make his own world. Toddlers will see themselves in clear, double-page spreads that show the boy on the carpet by the sofa, using colored blocks of different shapes and sizes to build a town by the sea. The simple rhyming words ("Great is the palace / with pillar and wall, / A sort of a tower / on the top of it all") and crisp computer graphics show how single shapes and objects can join in all kinds of scenarios. Then comes the power of knocking everything all down ("block upon block / lying scattered and free"), though the boy will always remember his town by the sea--even as he joins his friends outside in their suburban subdivision. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A German immigrant who worked in Philadelphia between 1809 and 1821, Krimmel was initially influenced by David Wilkie, William Hogarth, and Benjamin West. After revisiting Europe in 1817-18, he became inspired by German romanticism and found an appreciation for French neoclassical painting. His down-to-earth, slightly jocose, and at times gently moralizing approach to painting successfully linked the neoclassicist's sense of realism and structure with the romantic's dedication to nature and humanity.<br>In this authoritative examination, author Anneliese Harding traces the development of the artist through his sketchbook images and finished oil paintings. Seven sketchbooks now in the library at Winterthur contain about seven hundred separate drawings, ranging from quick pencil sketches to finished watercolor pictures, and are the key to reconstructing Krimmel's conceptual processes. When compared to one another, they show clear distinctions in subject matter and drawing style, commensurate to the stylistic development evident in his paintings. Harding places Krimmel's specialty, genre art, in an international context by discussing his work in terms of larger stylistic trends in American and European art and defines his use of democratic and moralizing themes within the political and social changes affecting Philadelphia and the Continent. The lasting appeal of Krimmel's pictures reflects the recognition that the images present positive aspects of life with an appealing freshness and convincing authenticity.</p><p>8 x 11 trim. 354 illus.

Special attention is paid to those forms of support privileged youth normally receive and working-class youth do not, such as expert guidance regarding college opportunities. The author also reveals how some working-class ethnic minority youth become the exception, weaving social webs that promote success in school as well as empowering forms of resiliency.

Yeats: A Life, Volume II: The Arch-Poet 1915-1939</h2><p>The first volume in Roy Foster's magisterial biography of W.B. Yeats was hailed as "a work of huge significance" (<em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>) and "a stupendous historiographical feat" (<em>Irish Sunday Independent</em>). Now, the eagerly awaited second volume explores the complex poetic, political, and personal intricacies of Yeats's dramatic final decades, a period that saw the Easter Rebellion, the founding of the Irish state in 1922, and the production of Yeats's greatest masterpieces. <br> In the conclusion of this first fully authorized biography, Foster brilliantly illuminates the circumstances--the rich internal and external experiences--that shaped the great poetry of Yeats's later years: "The Wild Swans at Coole," "Sailing to Byzantium," "The Tower," "The Circus Animals Desertion," "Under Ben Bulben," and many others. Yeats's pursuit of Irish nationalism and an independent Irish culture, his continued search for supernatural truths through occult experimentation, his extraordinary marriage, a series of tempestuous love affairs, and his lingering obsession with Maud Gonne are all explored here with a nuance and awareness rare in literary biography. Foster gives us the very texture of Yeats's life and thought, revealing the many ways he made poetry out of the "quarrel" with himself and the upheaval around him. But this consummate biography also shows that Yeats was much more than simply a lyric poet and examines in great detail Yeats's non-poetic work--his essays, plays, polemics, and memoirs. The enormous and varied circle of Yeats's friends, lovers, family, collaborators and antagonists inhabit and enrich a personal world of astounding energy, artistic commitment and verve; while the poet himself is shown returning again and again to his governing preoccupations, sex and death.<br> Based on complete and unprecedented access to Yeats's papers and written with extraordinary grace and insight, <em>W.B. Yeats, A Life</em> offers the fullest portrait yet of the private and public life of one of the twentieth century's greatest poets.<br></p><p>There are several biographies of the great Irish poet to choose from, and the one you&#39;ll prefer depends on how much biography you want. Subtitled &#34;The Apprentice Mage, 1865-1914,&#34; this is the one for completists (though they&#39;ll have to wait for Volume Two to get through Yeats&#39;s death in 1939). The author, a noted Irish historian, renders Yeats&#39;s life almost day to day, giving a particularly lively sense of the helter-skelter nature of his early years and a nice depiction of his tumultuous engagement with the Abbey Theatre.<br><strong>Roy Foster</strong> is Carroll Professor of Irish History at the University of Oxford and a fellow of Hertford College.

TO THE LIGHTHOUSE is Virginia Woolf&#39;s most popular novel. This definitive edition introduced by Quentin Bell contains the original Hogarth Press text as overseen by the author, and a list of the textual variants that appeared during her lifetime. The serene and maternal Mrs Ramsay, the tragic yet absurd Mr Ramsay together with their children and assorted guests are holidaying on the Isle of Skye. From the seemingly trivial postponement of a visit to a nearby lighthouse Virginia Woolf constructs a remarkable and moving examination of the complex tensions and allegiances of family life, and the conflict between male and female principles.</p><p>Mrs Ramsay (wife of a distinguished philosopher, mother of eight, and a sympathetic hostess) provides the heartbeat of a shabby-grand holiday house in the Hebrides and at the same time ceaselessly gauges the secret rhythms of its many intertwined pulses. Hers is the dominant interior monologue of this pre-first-world-war interlude. Other voices (most notably that of unmarried artist Lily Briscoe) fade in and out, and Juliet Stevenson turns this haunting story, in which nothing really happens, into a tone-poem of delicately nuanced probings into human relationships. The mood deepens when the neglected house is revisited, post-war, by surviving members of the holiday party, who must ultimately confront 'that loneliness that was the truth about things'. --Karen Robinson, The Sunday Times<br><br>Nicole Kidman in The Hours may have raised the doyenne of Bloomsbury bluestockings literary profile for a new generation of readers, but many people still consider Virginia Woolf's writing difficult and dated. It is. You either go along with descriptions such as, 'the spring, without a leaf to toss, bare and bright like a virgin fierce in her chastity, scornful in her purity, was laid out on fields, wide-eyed and watchful, and entirely careless of what was done, or thought, by the beholders...', or you don't. Somehow, though, when it is read in a voice as sensitive and intelligent as Juliet Stevenson's, you appreciate why critics have said that this, her best-known novel, contains some of the most beautiful prose ever written. Just as well, because there isn't much plot. The action, such as it is, takes place in the holiday home of the Ramsay family, on a Hebridean island before and after the great war. Mrs Ramsay is beautiful, Mr Ramsay difficult, their eight children relatively interesting, their house guests more so. It's the relationships that count, constantly shifting and elusive, dependent on a glance, a trick of light, an inflection of tone. Naxos does an abridged version, but don t be tempted. Woolf is all or nothing. --Sue Arnold, The Guardian<br><br>Thinking about my own reaction to To the Lighthouse, I enjoyed it more because of Juliet Stevenson's reading of it. She carried me along in the middle section when I was losing my way. And then I got fired up for it again. What the audiobook did was to impose some additional (and quite helpful) structure on the book. For example the last four tracks are called In the boat, Perspective, Approaching and Arriving. --Pete, Couch trip blogWith introductions by Eavan Boland and Maud Ellmann</p><h2>Swingin&#39; Fairy Tales and Jazzy Favorites (The Steinway Library of Piano Music)</h2><p>As with all books in this series, it includes a unique lay-flat binding to help keep the music open on the music stand.</p><p></p><h2>Taking the Train</h2><p>In the 1960s and early 1970s, young people in New York City radically altered the tradition of writing their initials on neighborhood walls. Influenced by the widespread use of famous names on billboards, in neon, in magazines, newspapers, and typographies from advertising and comics, city youth created a new form of expression built around elaborately designed names and initials displayed on public walls, vehicles, and subways. Critics called it "graffiti," but to the practitioners it was "writing." <br><br><i>Taking the Train</i> traces the history of "writing" in New York City against the backdrop of the struggle that developed between the city and the writers. Austin tracks the ways in which "writing"&#x2015; a small, seemingly insignificant act of youthful rebellion&#x2015;assumed crisis-level importance inside the bureaucracy and the public relations of New York City mayoral administrations and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for almost two decades. <i>Taking the Train</i> reveals why a global city short on funds made "wiping out graffiti" an expensive priority while other needs went unfunded. Although the city eventually took back the trains, Austin eloquently shows how and why the culture of "writing" survived to become an international art movement and a vital part of hip-hop culture.</p><p>Traces the history of graffiti in New York City against the backdrop of the struggle that developed between the city and the writers.Joe Austin, assistant professor in the Department of Popular Culture at Bowling Green State University, is coeditor of <i>Generations of Youth: Youth and Youth Cultures in the 20th Century.</i></p><h2>Artificial Intelligence: Theory and Practice</h2><p>Examines both theory and its practical applications.

The first satellite was launched in 1972 with great fanfare and high expectations. The data proved useful for everything from finding oil to predicting harvests, yet today the successful commercialization of the program is still uncertain. Why?<br> <br> To answer this question, Pamela E. Mack focuses on the negotiating process that went on among different parts of the space agency, other interested government agencies, and various organizations that were potential users of the data. This formal and informal negotiating process, she points out, involved not only choices between alternative technologies and the satellite but also conflicting definitions of what the satellite would do. The story is full of fascinating detail, from the concerns of the intelligence community over civilian satellites looking at the earth to the politics of agricultural survey.</p><p></p><h2>Locating and Correcting Reading Difficulties</h2><p><p><b></b> Updated and reorganized to be even more useful, this popular book's twenty-nine chapters divided into six major sections once again provide busy pre-service and in-service reading teachers the essential tools they need&#x2014;specific, concrete methods&#x2014;for helping struggling readers become successful readers. <b>KEY TOPICS</b> The authors' easy-to-read language effectively explains what to do in the diagnostic/remedial process; and twenty-four exceptionally thorough appendices offer hands-on tools for doing it. While individual instruction is clearly identified as the ideal, numerous strategies are also offered for both small- and large-group instruction. Emphasis is on direct instruction, motivational learning activities, and &#x201c;practice, practice, practice.&#x201d; <b></b> For elementary school reading teachers. </p></p><p>One of the most popular volumes in reading education...a practical, &#34;how to&#34; book that provides future elementary reading teachers with concrete, straightforward methods for identifying and correcting 28 common reading errors.<p> The eighth edition of this book, like previous editions, is organized to provide reading specialists, teachers, tutors, and reading education students with specific, concrete methods for locating and correcting reading difficulties. It can be used in classroom or remedial situations and is designed so that busy practitioners can find in one place the essential information they need to help struggling readers overcome their literacy difficulties. Direct instruction, motivational learning activities, and abundant practice in the act of reading are stressed. As in the previous editions, instruction in individual reading skills is recommended where appropriate; however, emphasis is also placed on the use of strategic approaches to the teaching of reading. </p> <p><b>ORGANIZING TO ASSIST STRUGGLING READERS</b></p> <p> This book is composed of 29 chapters, divided into six major parts, which cover the full range of reading and reading-related skills. While the major features of the previous edition have been retained, this new edition has been updated and reorganized to make the information within more accessible to the reader. </p> <p> <b>Methods and Approaches.</b> The first section of this book is an introductory chapter that provides information on important principles of effective instruction for students who have reading difficulties. It is hoped that these principles will guide your reading throughout the remainder of the book. This chapter also presents useful techniques or approaches for teaching students with reading difficulties. These techniques/approaches are included in this chapter because they apply to many of the specific reading problems that are the focus of subsequent chapters. The first approach describes a number of oral reading techniques that have been shown to be unusually effective in helping students as they struggle to master decoding skills. Equally important, these techniques are among the most powerful teachers can use to develop students' reading fluency and build a foundation for better reading comprehension. A second method is the language-experience approach, which benefits both beginning and remedial readers. In this section, you will find a thorough description of these approaches and many practical activities for application in the classroom or tutorial setting. </p> <p> As with previous editions, the Reading Diagnosis Chart (see page xiii) matches the logical development of various reading skills and corresponds to the order of the chapters. The basic format of each chapter is the same. A section titled "Recognized By" defines and/or describes the reading difficulty. The "Discussion" section provides additional background information and explains how to test or otherwise determine if a student is experiencing difficulty in this area. The "Recommendations" section offers an alphabetical listing of specific strategies or activities you may use to help the student overcome the problem. In most chapters, these suggestions are followed by a variety of "Games and Exercises" that may be used to provide students with independent practice. </p> <p> <b>Emergent Literacy.</b> Part 2 addresses emergent literacy skills. In this edition, Chapter 1 is now devoted entirely to phonemic awareness, reflecting recent research affirming the importance of this area in early reading development. Alphabet knowledge is now addressed separately in Chapter 2. Tests for phonemic awareness (in Appendix B-4) assess rhyming ability, initial sound recognition, phoneme blending, and phoneme segmentation. Specific instructional procedures added to Chapter 1 are matched to each of the skills tested. </p> <p> <b>Decoding Skills.</b> In previous editions, Part 3 consisted of chapters focusing on a variety of different oral reading problems. In nearly every case, these problems are caused by some weakness in the reader's decoding skills. For this reason, decoding skills are now presented <i>before</i> oral reading difficulties. In these chapters you will learn how to assess and teach various decoding skills such as sight vocabulary, phonics, structural analysis, and the use of context clues. </p> <p> <b>Oral Reading, Comprehension, and Study Skills.</b> Part 4 consists of 10 chapters on specific oral reading difficulties such as poor pronunciation, omissions, repetitions, and so on. Part 5 addresses comprehension skills. Part 6 addresses instruction in study skills and other skills essential to success in school. </p> <p><b>THE APPENDICES: TOOLS FOR LOCATING AND CORRECTING READING DIFFICULTIES</b></p> <p> We encourage readers to use the materials provided in the appendices for <i>locating</i> reading difficulties to construct their own diagnostic kits. These appendices include a code for marking in oral diagnosis and, as previously noted, a new set of tests for phonemic awareness. The appendices also include materials and directions for assessing students' knowledge of the alphabet, basic sight words and phrases, phonics, structural analysis, contractions, the use of context clues, and two reading interest surveys. A new test for assessing the reading interests of older students and adults has been added to this edition. Altogether, more than 30 different diagnostic tests are provided in these appendices. Specific directions and important points to remember are provided for administering each test or survey instrument. </p> <p> Thirteen appendices have been provided for <i>correcting</i> reading difficulties. The first, a new appendix titled "Books for Emergent Readers," consists of lists of rhyming books, books with alliteration, and alphabet books. You will also find appendices for basic sight word sentences, a phonics primer, and newly revised phonogram lists, including sentences and other new features in this popular phonics instructional program. Next is an appendix titled "Words for Teaching Short and Long Vowels," followed by "Words, Sentences, and Stories for Teaching Structural Analysis." The remaining appendices address prepositional phrases, prefixes and suffixes, the cloze procedure, a chart for graphing students' progress in using the technique of repeated readings, a description of and charts for graphing students' progress in using the precision reading technique, charts for graphing words per minute and comprehension, and suggestions for interviewing parents of disabled readers. </p> <p> Finally, definitions of terms appear in a glossary at the end of the book. </p></p><h2>A Companion to Assyria (Blackwell Companions to the Ancient World)</h2><p><p><i>A Companion to Assyria</i> is a collection of original essays on ancient Assyria written by key international scholars.

I regard it as one of the seminal books in the history of ideas. Based on a prodigious amount of original research, it demonstrated conclusively and in fascinating details how the transmission of ancient skepticism was a bital factor in the formation of modern thought. The story is rich in implications for th history of philosophy, the history of science, and the history of religious thought. Popkin&#39;s work has already inspired further work by others--and the new edition takes account of this, most importantly the work of Charles Schmitt. The two new chapters extend the story as far as Spinoza, with special reference to the beginnings of biblical criticism. . . . Popkin&#39;s history is of great potential interest to a wide readership--wider than most specialist publications and wider than it has (so far as I can tell) reached hitherto.&#34;--M.F. Burnyeat, Professor of Philosophy, University College London</p><p>The period I shall treat, 1500-1675, is certainly not the unique period of sceptical impact on modern thought. Both before and after this time interval, one can find important influences of the ancient sceptical thinkers. But, it is my contention that scepticism plays a special and different role in the period from the Reformation up to the formulation of the Cartesian philosophy; a special and different role due to the fact that the intellectual crisis brought on by the Reformation coincided in time with the rediscovery and revival of the arguments of the ancient Greek sceptics. In the sixteenth century, with the discovery of manuscripts of Sextus&#39;s writings, there is a revival of interest and concern with ancient scepticism, and with the application of its views to the problems of the day.<b>Richard H. Popkin</b> is Professor of Philosophy at Washington University, St. Louis, and was formerly at the University of California, San Diego.&nbsp;</p><h2>Direct Stone Sculpture : A Guide to Technique and Creativity</h2><p>The ancient and wonderful art of direct stone sculpture is brought to life in this comprehensive new book by the noted sculptor, Milt Liebson.

They sacrificed their individual yearnings to advance the causes of property rights and religious education for women at the time when such privileges and rights were non-existent. The laws giving them their inheritance were incorporated into the laws of the Torah. </p><p>This story shows that Judaism was the first religion to advance the status of women, more than 3,000 years before even the most progressive western civilizations acted in a similar manner.</p></p><p><b> Rabbi Shlomo Wexler</b> was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. Now retired in Israel, Rabbi Wexler spent 60 years of his life in the Diaspora, where he received a standard Orthodox Jewish education.

Using canonical directors and less established names, ranging from Chantal Akerman to Moufida Tlatli, as examples, Butler argues that women's cinema is unified in spite of its diversity by the ways in which it reworks cinematic conventions.</p><p>Alison Butler is lecturer in film studies at the University of Reading, UK.&#34;An invaluable addition to the literature around women&#39;s cinema, offering new and valuable material while at the same time clarifying vexed, overly-debated issues once and for all . . . beautifully written.&#34;</p><h2>Atlas of Exploration</h2><p>From the ancient Polynesians who struck out across the vast Pacific in dug-out canoes with only the stars to guide them, to the Victorian missionaries and adventurers who opened the way for European colonial expansion, and the intrepid scientists of our own time, explorers have long tested their courage in an uncharted world. <br><br><em>The Atlas of Exploration</em>, now in an updated Second Edition, is a splendidly illustrated and authoritative history of these bold adventures. With a vivid and informative text, supported by nearly 100 specially drawn maps and 300 photographs and illustrations, it traces these journeys of discovery from the earliest recorded trips, ranging from the time of the Phoenicians' voyages in the North Atlantic through the launch of the first Pluto explorer. We follow Cortes in Mexico, La Salle on the Mississippi, Darwin in the Galapagos Islands, James Cook in the Antarctic, and many others. In each section, graphic relief maps highlight the main routes of exploration, while photographs, paintings and engravings brilliantly capture the variety of terrain through which these courageous men and women passed. Also included are maps from different historical periods which reveal cartographers' growing knowledge of the shape of the world's continents and oceans. The final section of the atlas, thoroughly updated and expanded, covers many of the discoveries of the last decade. The Second Edition also contains new biographical details on many great explorers, geographers, and cartographers, plus a revised time chart which summarizes the history of exploration over 5000 years.<br> <br>From the High Andes to the ocean depths, from the Sahara desert to the outer planets, <em>The Atlas of Exploration</em> allows us to rediscover the extraordinary journeys of humanity.

When they were broadcast on BBC radio in 1952, the lectures created a sensation and confirmed Berlin&#x2019;s reputation as an intellectual who could speak to the public in an appealing and compelling way. A recording of only one of the lectures has survived, but Henry Hardy has recreated them all here from BBC transcripts and Berlin&#x2019;s annotated drafts. Hardy has also added, as an appendix to this new edition, a revealing text of "Two Concepts" based on Berlin&#x2019;s earliest surviving drafts, which throws light on some of the issues raised by the essay. And, in a new foreword, historian Enrique Krauze traces the origin of Berlin&#x2019;s idea of negative freedom to his rejection of the notion that the creation of the State of Israel left Jews with only two choices: to emigrate to Israel or to renounce Jewish identity.</p></p><p><p>"[Berlin's] lecturing style . . . proved enormously successful as broadcasting. . . . [H]undreds of thousands of people tuned in . . . to listen to fiendishly difficult hour-long talks, delivered in clipped, rapid-fire Oxford accent. These were the lectures that led Eliot, in his barbed way, to congratulate Isaiah for his 'torrential eloquence'; and the conservative Michael Oakeshotte to praise him, in equally barbed fashion, as 'the Paganini of the platform'. . . . The conventional signs of public attention poured in: anonymous ladies knitted him red socks; cranks sent him manuscripts. . . . The head of [the BBC's] Radio 3 hailed the talks as a landmark in British broadcasting, and they were certainly a landmark in Berlin's life. The search to find his own intellectual vocation had been a central preoccupation since his return from the war. With the broadcast of 'Freedom and Its Betrayal,' that struggle resolved itself. . . . He had become a public intellectual--in the Russian mould, but in an English idiom."<b>--Michael Ignatieff, <i>Isaiah Berlin: A Life</i></b></p><p>"This is one of the most important books on the history of ideas in Berlin's oeuvre. The lectures are clearer than many of his later writings and are extremely compelling. Berlin was convinced that, for all its praise of liberty, the Enlightenment was in fact hostile to it, and that the Counter-Enlightenment offered sounder intellectual grounds for defending and extending liberty. Even those who disagree with this diagnosis of modern thought will have to confront it."<b>--Mark Lilla, University of Chicago</b></p><b>Isaiah Berlin</b> (1909-1997) was one of the leading intellectual historians of the twentieth century and the founding president of Wolfson College, University of Oxford.

Ward, who enjoyed unprecedented access to FBI, Federal Bureau of Prisons, and Federal Parole records, conducted interviews with one hundred former Alcatraz convicts, guards, and administrators to produce this definitive history of "The Rock." <i>Alcatraz </i>is the only book with authoritative answers to questions that have swirled about the prison: How did prisoners cope psychologically with the harsh regime? What provoked the protests and strikes? How did security flaws lead to the sensational escape attempts? And what happened when these "habitual, incorrigible" convicts were finally released? By shining a light on the most famous prison in the world, Ward also raises timely questions about today's supermax prisons.</p><p>"Ward has collected the most impressive documentation anywhere on the workings of a prison. A unique and wonderful work of sociology and history."&#x2015;Howard Becker, author of <i>Outsiders: Studies in the Sociology of Deviance</i> and <i>Art Worlds</i><br><br>"This groundbreaking history of the country's most notorious prison is the first to give an in-depth analysis of the interaction between the guards and the prisoners. Ward captures the Alcatraz experience with the accuracy of someone who has practically been there and lays to rest many of the myths that have grown up around the prison. No longer will the story-tellers be able to describe the inmates as 'the worst of the worst' without qualification. Their individual stories come alive as the author records the varied life experiences that brought them to Alcatraz and describes their coping mechanisms.

In this book, Seyyed Hossein Nasr argues that the devastation of our world has been exacerbated, if not actually caused, by the reductionist view of nature that has been advanced by modern secular science. What is needed, he believes, is the recovery of the truth to which the great, enduring religions all attest; namely that nature is sacred.<br><br>Nasr traces the historical process through which Western civilization moved away from the idea of nature as sacred and embraced a world view which sees humans as alienated from nature and nature itself as a machine to be dominated and manipulated by humans. His goal is to negate the totalitarian claims of modern science and to re-open the way to the religious view of the order of nature, developed over centuries in the cosmologies and sacred sciences of the great traditions. Each tradition, Nasr shows, has a wealth of knowledge and experience concerning the order of nature. The resuscitation of this knowledge, he argues, would allow religions all over the globe to enrich each other and cooperate to heal the wounds inflicted upon the Earth.<br></p><p>The current ecological crisis is a matter of urgent global concern, with solutions being sought on many fronts.

An important focus in the book is the author's research into why Rikyu's tragic suicide, enforced by Hideyoshi, was a necessary outcome of the emerging conflict between ritual, art and politics. In addition, the study highlights the tensions and struggles between individual artists who were led by a sense of artistic identity and inspiration, together with the political leaders who imposed their artistic taste on the nation. Plutschow also provides new insights into the sixteenth-century Japanese perception of beauty - commonly called <i>wabi</i> - a simple, often austere beauty displayed in tea in order to unite host and guests as equals. This book will be of considerable interest in research connected with politics, Zen Buddhism and art history as well as the central issues regarding the history and development of tea in Japan.</p><p><b>Herbert Plutschow</b> was born in Switzerland and educated in Switzerland, England, Spain, France, Japan and the USA and got his PhD from Columbia University, New York.

S. Bach, we gain a striking picture of the composer as a unique critic of his age. By reading Bach's music "against the grain" of contemporaries such as Vivaldi and Telemann, Laurence Dreyfus explains how Bach's approach to musical invention in a variety of genres posed a fundamental challenge to Baroque aesthetics.</p><p>"Invention"--the word Bach and his contemporaries used for the musical idea that is behind or that generates a composition--emerges as an invaluable key in Dreyfus's analysis. Looking at important pieces in a range of genres, including concertos, sonatas, fugues, and vocal works, he focuses on the fascinating construction of the invention, the core musical subject, and then shows how Bach disposes, elaborates, and decorates it in structuring his composition. <i>Bach and the Patterns of Invention</i> brings us fresh understanding of Bach's working methods, and how they differed from those of the other leading composers of his day. We also learn here about Bach's unusual appropriations of French and Italian styles--and about the elevation of various genres far above their conventional status.</p><p>Challenging the restrictive lenses commonly encountered in both historical musicology and theoretical analysis, Dreyfus provocatively suggests an approach to Bach that understands him as an eighteenth-century thinker and at the same time as a composer whose music continues to speak to us today.</p></p><p>Laurence Dreyfus is Professor of Music at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of Magdalen College.[<i>Bach and Patterns of Invention</i>] stands head and shoulders above anything else in the field of post-war Bach criticism....Dreyfus believes that the human side of the compositional process is what must interest us about Bach, the sense of an intelligence adhering strictly to the rules he considered God-given, while freely abusing those that his contemporaries held dear. In this way we might attain a sense of the very historical nature of Bach's music--not merely the generic and formal similarities within the idioms of his age (often the principal object of modern scholarship), but particularly the way in which the composer went against the grain of his age. (John Butt <i>Early Music</i>)<br><br>Laurence Dreyfus's <i>Bach and Patterns of Invention</i>...is the first study in some time to deal above all with the reasons that music lovers ought to listen to him or play him. Dreyfus's writing is clear and entertaining..and the advantage of [his] approach to Bach is that it makes us listen to his work as he himself listened to the music of his contemporaries, and as they would have listened to his. It does not claim to read the composer's mind, but it reconstructs some of the processes through which he had to go to compose in each case, and it does so by referring to aural experience, leaving questions of ideology and doctrine temporarily on the side. (Charles Rosen <i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>An original and detailed appraisal of Bach's achievement...Much of this book is concerned with detailed analysis that tries to illuminate, and at least to some extent to recreate, Bach's processes of composition. The result is the uncovering of processes that appear somewhat messy but are convincingly real. This is a fundamentally imaginative approach to analysis...Dreyfus's ideas should be of interest to anyone interested in exploring new ways of understanding 18th-century music. (Barry Mitchell <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>)<br><br>Dreyfus's new analytical study of Bach's processes of composition...challenges received ideas about what constitutes a style, a form and a genre in Bach's music, showing how the composer's individuality stems largely from his writing 'against the grain'. Dreyfus's book is not always easy, and neither is Bach's music, but few readers--even the more general--of the former will be left without a better understanding of the latter. (Malcolm Boyd <i>BBC Music Magazine</i>)<br><br>Johann Sebastian Bach is not the easiest of composers to write about, for his music can often seem so perfect that it renders description irrelevant. But <i>Bach and the Patterns of Invention</i>, by Laurence Dreyfus, a...totally absorbing study of Bach's processes of composition, is written with a clarity appropriate to a discussion of his music and with an enthusiasm that immediately communicates itself. (Charles Osborne <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>)<br><br>This brilliant book sets out to answer one of the enduring mysteries of music namely, what was the compositional method that allowed Bach to write such a vast quantity of music of such surpassing quality?...It's a moving and convincing picture of Bach, and a thoroughly original one, delivered in lucid prose in which close argumentation is often capped by an illuminating metaphor. Like Bach's music, it is rhetorical in the best sense. (Ivan Hewett <i>The Music Times</i>)<br><br>An original and detailed appraisal of Bach's achievement...Much of this book is concerned with detailed analysis that tries to illuminate, and at least to some extent to recreate, Bach's processes of composition. The result is the uncovering of processes that appear somewhat messy but are convincingly real. This is a fundamentally imaginative approach to analysis, involving as it does speculations about the order in which the inventions of the piece were composed and the role of procedures that were started by the composer but destined for only partial success due to the grammar of tonal music...Dreyfus's ideas should be of interest to anyone interested in exploring new ways of understanding 18th-century music. (Barry Mitchell <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i>)<br><br>Dreyfus is concerned with how Bach thought in music, but from that deduces some idea of how he thought about music. A stimulating book.

[Wilson and DiIulio's work in the public sector over the past years enhances their impressive academic credentials. The fact that they have worked for both Republicans and Democrats and the evenhanded manner with which they have covered the major topics in the text allays any reservations that this text doesn't give every side of an issue fair treatment.... I stand in awe of how Wilson and DiIulio are able to package so much solid information in such few pages.... This is as solid and intellectually honest a textbook as one could hope for. It should be the standard by which all others are measured. The emphasis on students using their critical thinking skills to reach conclusions on issues of the day provides a firm foundation....

She notes, "The longer an illness or incapacity lasts, the harder it becomes for us to maintain faith in our helper's good will," adding, "most people resist dependence and struggle to maintain a secure sense of identity by asking for as little as they can." Although the author's observations, as well as those from such diverse sources as Proust biographer George Painter and Arthur Kleinman, author of The Illness Narrative , comprise much of the text, these references interrupt the real story, which is related by patients themselves.

It is thus crucial to provide statisticians with a practical understanding of those methods, and there is no better way to develop intuition and skills for simulation than to use simulation to solve statistical problems. <em>Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R</em> covers the main tools used in statistical simulation from a programmer's point of view, explaining the R implementation of each simulation technique and providing the output for better understanding and comparison. While this book constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation methods, the theoretical justification of those methods has been considerably reduced, compared with Robert and Casella (2004). Similarly, the more exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered here.</p> <p>This book does not require a preliminary exposure to the R programming language or to Monte Carlo methods, nor an advanced mathematical background. While many examples are set within a Bayesian framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian statistics is not required. The book covers basic random generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques for integration and optimization, convergence diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including Metropolis {Hastings and Gibbs algorithms, and adaptive algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R programs are available as an R package called mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical interest in simulation methods but no previous exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The programming parts are introduced progressively to be accessible to any reader.</p> <p><strong>Christian P.

There are exercises within and at the end of all chapters ... . Overall, the level of the book makes it suitable for graduate students and researchers. Others who wish to implement Monte Carlo methods, particularly MCMC methods for Bayesian analysis will also find it useful.&#x201d; (David Scott, International Statistical Review, Vol. 78 (3), 2010)</p><p>&#x201c;The primary audience is graduate students in statistics, biostatistics, engineering, etc. who need to know how to utilize Monte Carlo simulation methods to analyze their experiments and/or datasets. ... this text does an effective job of including a selection of Monte Carlo methods and their application to a broad array of simulation problems. ...

However, &#x2018;development&#x2019; has always been a contested idea. While often presented as a positive process to improve people&#x2019;s lives, the potential negative dimensions of &#x2018;development&#x2019; on people and environments must also be recognized. </p> <p><em>Theories and Practices of Development</em> provides a clear and user-friendly introduction to the complex debates around how development has been understood and achieved. The second edition has been fully updated and expanded to reflect global political and economic shifts, as well as new approaches to development. The rise of China and India is given particular attention, as is the global economic crisis and its implications for development theories and practice. There are new sections on faith-based development, and the development dimensions of climate change, as well as greater engagement with development theories as they are put into practice in the Global North. </p> <p>The book deals with the evolution of development ideas and policies, focusing on economic, political, social, environmental and spatial dimensions. It highlights how development cannot be considered as a neutral concept, but is entwined with inequalities in power at local, as well as national and global scales. The use of boxed examples, tables and illustrations helps students understand complex theoretical ideas and also demonstrates how development theories are put into practice in the real world. Each chapter ends with a summary section, discussion topics, suggestions for further reading and website resources. </p></p><p><p><strong>Katie Willis </strong>is Reader in Development Geography and Director of the Centre for Developing Areas Research at Royal Holloway, University of London.</p><p><strong>"In this accessible, lucid, and beautifully organised book, Katie Willis combines up-to-date conceptual summaries with nicely worked empirical examples to illuminate contemporary development policy and practice.&nbsp;This book is both a major scholarly achievement and magnificent guide for those new to the subject.

In the first systematic account of this field, they focus on the major social variables that influence health, including socioeconomic position, income distribution, race/ethnicity, gender, social networks/social support, social capital and community cohesion, work environment, life transitions, and affective psychological states. Individual chapters describe the conceptualization and measurement of each social variable, as well as the empirical evidence linking them to a broad range of mental, physical, and behavioral health outcomes. The volume draws on the expertise of an internationally renowned group of scholars, representing the diversity of disciplines relevant to this emerging field, from sociology and psychology to physiology and medicine. The approaches covered by the chapters span the range from formulating and testing hypotheses about the links between social conditions and health to designing and implementing interventions and social policies to improve population health. The challenge of persistent social inequalities in health across the globe makes this a timely publication. The book will be an indispensable introduction to the field for students, researchers, practitioners, and policy analysts.</p><p>Lisa F. Berkman is at Harvard School of Public Health. Ichiro Kawachi is at Harvard School of Public Health.This book is an extraordinary work of scholarship. The concepts and findings set forth so lucidly in Social Epidemiology help to clarify puzzling phenomena in medical practice and investigation. It is remarkably free of jargon and should prove accessible to every physician. To my knowledge, this is the first textbook in the new field. Its excellence provides assurance that it will become a classic. <p> Some Journal readers may wonder what social epidemiology is. Berkman and Kawachi define it as "the branch of epidemiology that studies the social distribution and social determinants of health." The field incorporates the concepts and methods of "disciplines ranging from sociology, psychology, political science, economics, demography and biology." However, more is at stake than broadening the scope of inquiry beyond the usual physical and biologic suspects. At its best (as exemplified repeatedly in this book), social epidemiology embodies a new focus on the community as an entity in itself, an entity more complex than the sum of the individual persons who make it up, but one that acts on and through those people to influence the health status of each. This approach represents a conceptual shift in epidemiologic research and theory. It highlights features of the social world to which biomedical studies are ordinarily blind. </p><p> Physicians have known for a long time that the way people live affects their health. Indeed, the author or authors of the Hippocratic treatise Airs, Waters, Places enjoined "whoever wishes to pursue properly the science of medicine" to consider among other features of the place of practice the "mode of life of the inhabitants... whether they are heavy drinkers, taking lunch and inactive, or athletic, industrious, eating much and drinking little." More than two millennia were to pass before these and other intuitive hypotheses (most of which proved to be wrong) were put to the test. It is not news that poverty is associated with poor health, although controversy persists about the direction of causality (from poverty to illness or illness to poverty), about the most effective interventions (social measures or health measures), and about other such matters (which are discussed by Lynch and Kaplan in chapter 2). </p><p> It may not be news that people without means have less access to care and that the care they get is of lower quality. But it became news in recent years, and painful news at that, to learn that members of minority groups and women are less likely to receive aggressive medical and surgical interventions even when payment is not an issue (as in the case of patients who are covered by Medicare or enrolled in the Veterans Affairs system). The effect of discrimination on health is thoughtfully examined by Nancy Krieger, who begins chapter 3 with two statements: "Inequality hurts. Discrimination harms health." She then marshals the evidence to document both claims. </p><p> But it will be news to most physicians that higher mortality rates are associated with greater social disparity; in other words, the magnitude of the economic differential between the folks at the top and the folks at the bottom of the social ladder influences death rates. For example, in a study of income inequality and mortality in 300 U.S. metropolitan areas, areas with greater inequality between the groups had higher mortality rates than areas with narrower extremes. This is not another of the statistically significant but clinically unimportant findings sometimes reported by large population surveys. The aggregate excess in mortality was as great as the combined loss of life from lung cancer, diabetes, motor vehicle crashes, human immunodeficiency virus infection, homicide, and suicide. What is it about inequality? The short answer is that no one knows. Differences in identified individual risk factors account for less than half the observed disparity. Hypotheses about this phenomenon and ways to test them are incisively presented by Kawachi, Brunner, and Marmot in separate chapters. </p><p> Lisa Berkman, senior editor and coauthor of three chapters, is one of the pioneering researchers in social epidemiology. Her first major study, published 20 years ago, is a landmark. In longitudinal research on a randomly sampled population of the community, she identified persons in the top quartile of social connectedness (defined in terms of marital ties, kinship, friendships, and group participation) and found that they were less likely to die during the subsequent nine-year period than the relatively socially isolated persons in the lowest quartile. The statistical significance of the mortality differential held up after adjustment for health status and the risky health behavior recorded at the initial examination. She went on to show that lack of social support decreases the likelihood of survival after myocardial infarction, increases the probability of depression in the elderly, and leads to higher rates of cognitive decline. As an original investigator and careful scholar, she offers an integrated account of the effect on health of cultural, ethnic, and class-related variations in the structure and function of social networks. </p><p> The list of authors is a Who's Who of social epidemiology. Each chapter is thorough without being encyclopedic; the bibliographies are comprehensive without being exhaustive. This book gives physicians an intellectual adventure by putting new ways of looking at health problems in context. In addition to such notions as income disparity as a risk factor and social connectedness as a protective factor, Kawachi and Berkman provide a stimulating account of "social capital," a concept that has recently gained prominence and one that they define as "those features of social structures, such as levels of interpersonal trust and norms of reciprocity and mutual aid, which act as resources for individuals and facilitate collective action." </p><p> Social capital has a substantial effect on the probabilities of good or bad health. The epidemiologic research carried out by Kawachi and his coworkers has demonstrated significant correlations between health and such indicators of social capital as interpersonal trust, reciprocity, and the extent of membership in voluntary organizations. How might this come about? The possibilities include the placing of social constraints on deviant health behavior (smoking, drinking, and drug abuse), the availability of better community services and amenities as a result of political solidarity, and the provision of emotional support and respect. What maintains social capital? "Trusting social environments...be get trustworthy citizens." Can we design policy to build social capital? Finding ways to do so may be the most important task American democracy faces. This and related issues are addressed in Jody Heymann's splendid chapter on health and social policy. </p><p> What do I see for the coming editions? Permit me to be a visionary. These days, just about every physician encounters the word "genomics" and knows that large-scale DNA sequencing is expected to provide the precise structure of the human genome before 2003. Most know that genes specify proteins. However, the three-dimensional structure and function of the proteins cannot be determined from the DNA matrix. Some physicians are beginning to encounter the term "proteomics" -- the large-scale analysis of proteins that will become the scientific frontier of the post-genomic decade. These developments portend exciting times for medicine. </p><p> The coming scientific frontier will be some version of "sociobiomics" (a neologism that I hope will not outlive this book review). It will be a long-term, interdisciplinary research project to specify the forces within and among social groups that interact with the biologic uniqueness of each member of those groups (and the environment they inhabit) to determine whether individuals stay well or fall ill. Admittedly, my rhetoric is somewhat overheated, but it is meant to call attention to the context that Social Epidemiology illuminates and that future editions will shine an even brighter light on. </p><p> <i>Leon Eisenberg, M.D.</i> <br>Copyright � 2000 Massachusetts Medical Society.

But this fact has been overlooked in most organizations. In this brilliant and strongly argued new book, Sally Helgesen and Julie Johnson demonstrate why &#x201c;the female vision&#x201d;&#x2014;what women notice, what they value, how they connect the dots&#x2014;constitutes women&#x2019;s most powerful asset in the workplace. Drawing on multiple strands of research, including their own Satisfaction Profile Assessment, they show what companies must do to engage, energize, and support talented women. And they show women how to nurture and sustain their own greatest gifts.</p><p>Sally Helgesen is a renowned speaker and the author of five books, including the classic bestseller The Female Advantage and The Web of Inclusion.<br> Julie Johnson, a graduate of Harvard Business School, is a pioneer in the field of executive coaching and has coached many of the most successful women in the Fortune 500.What Women See<br><br> What we notice, what we believe is important, and what we perceive life should be are the primary components that shape our vision. The more authentically we understand, express, and act on the distinctive aspects of what we see, the greater our contribution will be and the more we&#x2019;ll fulfill our purpose in the world.<br><br> Translating vision into practice is challenging for anyone, but it can be especially difficult for women in organizations. This is because what women see can be out of sync with what the workplace expects. Having entered the workplace in significant numbers and having begun to assume positions of authority and influence only in the last thirty years, women have had little opportunity to shape the culture of work&#x2014;its values, assumptions, and expectations.<br><br> The disconnect between what organizations expect and what women at their best have to offer has become an issue as workplace demands have grown more intense. Companies today require more from their people&#x2014;more time, greater commitment, fresher ideas, a continual learning curve. Thriving in this environment requires passion and engagement. But it&#x2019;s difficult to feel fully engaged when your vision, your fundamental way of seeing things, is not understood, recognized, or valued. And it&#x2019;s tough to feel passionate when you feel unable to bring what is best about yourself to your work.<br><br> When women&#x2019;s ways of seeing are not validated, it short-changes women, requiring them to exercise their skills without drawing on the full power of what they notice and value. Operating at less than full capacity undermines their effectiveness and their ability to feel authentic, as well as keeping them from being fully present in the moment. It can also leach away the zestfulness and fun that comes from engaging what is best within themselves and putting that forth into the world.<br><br> When women&#x2019;s ways of seeing are not validated, it also shortchanges their organizations, narrowing the base of talents and ideas from which they can draw. In a global environment where change is constant, companies need to be nimble, innovative, and very smart, which is why relying on the usual suspects to do the usual things in the usual way is no longer effective. When organizations fail to appreciate the fullness and scope of what women have to offer, they diminish their capacity to &#x201c;think outside the box&#x201d;&#x2014;a frequently stated objective&#x2014;because the blinders they require their people to wear keep them firmly inside it.<br><br> We&#x2019;ve all seen what happens when women&#x2019;s ways of seeing are not recognized or are dismissed as being beside the point. The consequences play out on a large scale&#x2014;which we&#x2019;ll explore later&#x2014;and in the smallest interactions.<br><br> For example, Jim and Jill are walking out of a sales meeting in which the regional manager has been outlining the sales figures he expects their team to meet in the next quarter. As they step into the hall, Jim, who was scribbling down numbers during the presentation, says, &#x201c;I figure it&#x2019;s doable if we can get client X to expand his budget by 6 percent while cutting our costs by $3.2 million.&#x201d;<br><br> Jill nods. &#x201c;That sounds about right. But did you notice how Ron in the back of the room seemed depressed? He&#x2019;s usually so outgoing and engaged.&#x201d;<br><br> Jim doesn&#x2019;t respond. He&#x2019;s wondering why Jill is making an irrelevant comment. She needs to be thinking about how they can make their numbers, not worrying about what someone else is feeling. Besides, Jim wasn&#x2019;t looking at Ron. For one thing, he doesn&#x2019;t have eyes in the back of his head. Plus, he was focused on the presentation, which is exactly what the regional manager would expect.<br><br> Jill was paying attention, too, but not in a single-minded way. For example, she was aware that some of the attendees couldn&#x2019;t hear what the presenter was saying&#x2014;not surprising since he has a habit of speaking too fast and then getting testy when someone asks him to repeat his remarks. But it was Ron&#x2019;s disinterest that most caught her attention. He&#x2019;s key to the team&#x2019;s effort, and it&#x2019;s going to be a rough road for everyone if he&#x2019;s struggling.<br><br> Still, it&#x2019;s clear to Jill that Jim doesn&#x2019;t want to pursue the subject. She&#x2019;s not sure she can make him understand that she was engaged by the presentation but was also taking in a lot of other things. She also wants to signal to him that she&#x2019;s on board. So she says simply, &#x201c;I think your numbers are right on target.&#x201d;<br><br> This brief exchange typifies a fundamental dynamic that occurs thousands of time every day in the workplace. Both Jim and Jill are bringing useful information to their encounter: Jim by proposing specifics that could move the team ahead, Jill by noting a potential problem that could undermine it. Both Jim&#x2019;s focus and Jill&#x2019;s active antenna offer clear benefits to their sales team.<br><br> However, Jim can&#x2019;t see the value in what Jill is trying to contribute, nor has Jill framed her observations in a way that compels Jim&#x2019;s interest. Once Jill senses his skepticism, she backs off rather than persisting in trying to make her case. She gives up on trying to help Jim understand what she sees and tries to placate him instead. As a result, the team misses out on potentially vital information. And Jill winds up ignoring her own best insights, thereby undermining the value she could otherwise bring to the effort.<br><br> Such incidents occur because what Jill notices, believes is important, and perceives her company should be&#x2014;the components of her vision&#x2014;are to a large extent countercultural in her organization. Sure, the senior executives talk a lot about how &#x201c;our people are our most important asset.&#x201d; They even had the phrase printed up as a &#x201c;vision statement&#x201d; on a laminated card. But it&#x2019;s not their authentic vision because it doesn&#x2019;t reflect what they actually notice or value or how they operate. It&#x2019;s just some-thing the president&#x2019;s speechwriter thought would sound good.<br><br> Jim accepts the discrepancy between what the company says and how it acts, and forges ahead. But Jill can&#x2019;t help wishing the company would match its actions to its words. If it did, she&#x2019;d feel more at home and would have more to contribute. The company would also be a better place to work and would probably have better relationships with clients as a result.<br><br> But there&#x2019;s another reason that Jill&#x2019;s observations are not particularly valued in her organization, and that has to do with numbers. Most of what she notices, values, and would like to see can&#x2019;t be easily quantified or expressed by an equation. Many of her perceptions are relatively subjective. By contrast, Jim and the regional division head pride themselves on sticking to what the numbers tell them. The sales VP whom they report to is known for cutting discussions short with a brusque, &#x201c;Just get to the bottom line.&#x201d; This reflects the company&#x2019;s presumption that numbers are not only an essential business tool but the final determinant of value.<br><br> Jill was a math whiz in college, and she can tote up a spreadsheet with the best of them. But she&#x2019;s never believed that numbers tell the whole story. She can&#x2019;t deliver an algorithm to prove that Ron is in a fragile state or offer a figure that quantifies how much his distraction could cost the sales team. Unable to put what she notices in a numerical frame, she can&#x2019;t figure out how to advocate for the value of her observations&#x2014;so she ends up backing off entirely. She stuffs what she sees, and as a result her interaction with Jim is less authentic and productive than it otherwise might be.<br><br> Dr. Mary O&#x2019;Malley, a neuroscientist and psychiatrist who works with senior executive women, sees exchanges such as the one between Jill and Jim all the time.1 She notes that women often have difficulty defending the value of what they see in part because the traditional workplace is not necessarily structured to recognize subjective observation. Lacking support, women are likely to lose confidence in the value of what they have to offer and may internalize their inability to do so as a failure. Suppressing their best insights also makes women feel out of place and lowers the quality and authenticity of their exchanges. In the end, everybody loses.<br><br> Of course, not all women are like Jill, nor are all men like Jim. We&#x2019;re all individuals whose talents and aptitudes fall along a spectrum. Some women are totally focused on the bottom line and some men exhibit sensitivity to the nuances of human interaction. Some women do not question organizational values and commitments, and some men most certainly do.<br><br> But, in general, women&#x2019;s observational style tends to be broad and wide-ranging, while men tend to focus more narrowly on what they perceive as relevant to the task at hand. Women are continually scanning their environment for information, whereas men are more apt to restrict their observations to what a specific set of actions requires.2 These complementary capabilities should be a source of strength and offer a perfect demonstration of the benefits that diversity can bring to organizations.<br><br> But because diversity is often viewed as a numbers game&#x2014;&#x201c;We will increase our percentage of women at director level by 30 percent over the next five years&#x201d;&#x2014;companies often end up missing the larger picture. Diversity does not result simply from creating a richer demographic mix. True diversity is the diversity of values.3<br><br> A Brief History of Attention<br><br> A physicist might describe the difference between men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s ways of seeing by saying that women&#x2019;s attention operates like radar, picking up signals across a wide spectrum, whereas men&#x2019;s attention operates like a laser, focusing on a single point in depth. Attention is the key word here, for what we see is determined by where we direct our attention. Our attention in turn is shaped by how we are accustomed to engaging our senses in the exercise of habitual skills. If we repair cars, we recognize the sound of a faulty belt as soon as the engine engages; if we bake bread, we can tell when a rising loaf is ready for the oven by pressing a finger to its surface. Our skills and experience channel our attention.<br><br> Given that men and women have until very recently exercised very different skills in the world, it&#x2019;s hardly surprising that they would&#x2014;again, in general&#x2014;attend to different things and have different ways of assigning value. Anthropologists like Helen Fisher believe the difference goes all the way back to the earliest phases of human history, when men contributed to their tribe&#x2019;s survival with their hunting prowess while women sustained the group by gathering plants.4 Clearly, the ability to focus attention on a single task is an advantage when pursuing antelope across the plains, whereas reading the environment broadly is useful when your job is to choose which roots are safe and nourishing while also caring for babies and raising children.<br><br> As people settled into small communities, men and women continued to exercise different skills, with men protecting the group and women doing pretty much everything else. As agriculture grew more complex, the division of labor continued, with men working the fields and women tending to house and garden. When work became centralized in the industrial era, men moved from farms into factories and offices while women stayed at home to do the domestic work. With few exceptions, women who did work outside the home were driven by fierce financial necessity. Poorly paid, undereducated, and excluded from leadership positions, they didn&#x2019;t play much of a role in shaping the culture of the industrial workplace.<br><br> But the divide that has separated men and women since the dawn of civilization began to erode during the last thirty or forty years, as women entered the workplace in significant numbers and closed the historic education gap with men. This in turn has resulted in men taking a far more active role in raising children and has changed our perception of what it means to be a father. Men and women now exercise many of the same skills in the course of their everyday lives and share more aspects of their daily experience. This erosion of separate spheres has gained speed over the last twenty years as cheap, powerful, networked technologies have decentralized the workplace and begun to transform how both men and women work and live.<br><br> The tools we use determine the skills we develop, giving order to our experience and providing us with an identity in the world. The spear, the helmet, and the plow are ancient symbols of male activity, while the infant, the spade, and the spinning wheel have from earliest times symbolized the work of women. This identification of tool with gender persisted well into the industrial era; when Sally graduated from high school, for example, she was given a gold typewriter charm for her bracelet, a symbol that she intended to become a &#x201c;career girl.&#x201d;<br><br> But the advent of the personal computer ended the identification of tool with gender, signaling a major shift in the relationship between men and women. For the first time in human history, men and women are not only using the same primary tool in their work but are also using different iterations of that tool to manage their personal and domestic lives. This requires them to develop similar skills and to use a common language, making our daily experience more similar to each others&#x2019; than in the past.5<br><br> As the tissue and the texture of men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s lives become more similar, our ways of being in the world become less tied to and determined by gender. Yet we retain fundamental distinctions that are a legacy of our different but complementary histories, for evolution proceeds at a slower pace than technological or social change. One of the most important of these distinctions is the difference in how men and women direct their attention, which in turn determines what we see.<br><br> We bring our individual ways of seeing with us to our daily work. The diversity of our perceptions has the potential to broaden and enrich the scope of how organizations make decisions and form connections in the marketplace, but all too often this does not occur. Despite an often sincerely stated commitment to supporting and developing women&#x2019;s talent, many organizations still do not know how to value women&#x2019;s ways of seeing or understand how to use women&#x2019;s insights to their advantage.<br><br> The costs to organizations of this failure are not easily quantifiable, but they are very real. The costs to women are more obvious. When women&#x2019;s most authentic observations are not valued, they either resign themselves to suppressing their best contributions, or they decide to take their insights and talents elsewhere. In either case, their capacity as leaders is diminished.<br><br> Acting on What We See<br><br> We make our vision tangible by acting on what we see. Our actions provide the link between what we see and what we achieve in the world. When we don&#x2019;t have the opportunity to act on our perceptions, our true potential to contribute remains locked inside ourselves. What should be a source of power in the world becomes a source of frustration. This damages our ability to bring our whole self to our tasks and sets us up to feel inauthentic even when we are doing our jobs. Because our minds are divided, we can&#x2019;t be fully ourselves.<br><br> Dr. O&#x2019;Malley believes that the disconnect between what women see and what their organizations value may be the primary reason that women are more likely than men to report feeling fraudulent at work.6 Elizabeth, a top editor at a major financial magazine, provides a perfect example.<br><br> My boss and colleagues always said I was doing a good job, but I never felt I was because I wasn&#x2019;t able to bring my best thinking to my work.

At a previous agency in the early 2000s, he lead companies such as Baskin-Robbins and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric into the fray of modern client-side practices while managing development between offices in Los Angeles, China, and New York. <br> <br>If your budget only allows for one HTML5 and CSS3 book, this book is a terrific way to invest your money. I&#x2019;ve reviewed HTML5 for Web Designers and Introducing HTML5 on this blog. I think this book is better than either of those books. That&#x2019;s not saying the two books mentioned are not excellent books, because they are. I&#x2019;ve read both of those books carefully and I still learned new and helpful things from HTML5 and CSS3. Plus, the VQS style is inherently easy to use with each topic detailed in small step-by-step bits. It&#x2019;s so easy to find the one thing you need to know at any given moment with a VQS book.<br> <br>Another advantage this book over the others I mentioned is that it can get a beginner going but it also offers a lot of good information for the experienced HTML and CSS wonk. If you&#x2019;re teaching either of these topics, this book is classroom gold.<br> <br>Definitely recommended. - Virginia DeBolt, webteacher.ws</p><h2>The Canine Good Citizen: Every Dog Can Be One, Second Edition</h2><p>...purebred or mixed, with this book any dog can become a Canine Good Citizen.... The Volhards'...approach to training, which they call the Motivational Method,...is designed to do just that motivate the owner and the dog. The Motivational Method is grounded on a thorough knowledge of how people learn and dog behavior. Since 1983 they have authored or co-authored four major books on dog training and teaching dog Obedience classes, and have produced four video tapes. I am...pleased that they have written this book on the Canine Good Citizen. I cannot think of anyone else who could have done a better job. This book contains everything the reader needs to know about training any dog to become a Canine Good Citizen. Still, there is much more the book shares a wealth of insights for the beginner, as well as the experienced dog person. The book's best feature is that it gives each person the means to tailor the training to the individual dog's character and temperament. It thoroughly explains what makes dogs different and how these differences dictate the approach to training that needs to be taken. James E. Dearinger, AKC Vice President, Obedience<br><br>The American Kennel Club's Canine Good Citizen program was developed to promote responsible dog ownership in a manner that would be easy for both dog and owner.

Yes, every dog, both pure-bred dogs and mixed breeds, can be a good citizen if their owners care enough to make it happen. The key is to encourage dog owners everywhere to be responsible enough to make their dogs a pleasure to be around and able to handle most situations that they might be expected to encounter in everyday life.""

Wendy is the recipient of four awards from the DWAA and developed the most widely used system for evaluating and selecting puppies. Her film, Puppy Aptitude Testing, was named Best Film on Dogs for 1980 by the DWAA. She also devised a Personality Profile for dogs to help owners gain a better understanding of their pets. Her article &#34;Drives?A New Look at an Old Concept&#34; was named Best Article in a Specialty Magazine for 1991 by the DWAA.

The Volhards have obtained over fifty Obedience titles, multiple High in Trial awards and Dog World Awards of Canine Distinction with their Landseer Newfoundlands, Yorkshire Terrier, Standard Wirehaired Dachshund, Labrador Retriever and German Shepherd Dog.The Canine Good Citizen test, introduced by the American Kennel Club in recent years, hardly requires a special course of training-designed to certify that a dog has basic obedience skills, the CGC consists of 10 simple exercises for the dog, from sitting "politely" for petting to walking on a loose leash to a down-stay with the owner 20 feet away. But passing the CGC is as good a goal as any in dog training, and the Volhards (he is coauthor, with Bartlett, of What All Good Dogs Should Know; she has made award-winning training films) do a wonderful job of arming the reader with skills, techniques and philosophies. Their discussions are succinct and sober: a remarkably cogent section about teaching specific postures (sit, heel, etc.) and practices is preceded by a concise discussion of managing stress while training; a "Pack Leader's Bill of Rights" simplifies the often-clouded concept of pack theory; a schedule suggests the expected rate of progress. However, a "personality profile" aiming to help tell the reader which "drive" (prey, pack or defense) most motivates a given dog has pop appeal, but offers little beyond the obvious; you don't need to be Konrad Lorenz to know what motivates your own dog.

Drawing on the expertise of leading scholars in German history, musicology, and German literature, the essays assembled here examine philosophy, literature, politics, and social currents, as well as the creation and performance of folk music, art music, church music, jazz, and pop to explore the ways in which music has continued to play a central role in the German national imagination and in shaping German identity.</p></p><p>Concert halls all over the world feature mostly the works of German and Austrian composers as their standard repertoire: composers like the three "Bs" of classical music, Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms, all of whom are German.

Essential features include: a listing of common minerals with their most important distinguishing optical properties; over two hundred illustrations detailing the relation between optics and crystal morphology; an accompanying CD-ROM with color slides illustrating rock-forming minerals and the textures of rocks, many with text and audio annotations by the author; descriptions of the textures and structures of igneous and metamorphic rocks; the most important properties of all the minerals compiled in an easy-to-access, full-color table; and a chart for determining the approximate modal (volume) percentage of minerals in rocks. The classification of igneous rocks used in the book is the one proposed by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) Subcommission of the Systematics of Igneous Rocks.

The lessons in this story are crucial for anyone involved in renewal or revival. &#34;Over the last two millenniums, the church has experienced many revivals, renewals, and reformation movements. Some have been used to spur the entire church to spiritual advancement. One of the greatest of these was the Azusa Street Revival of 1906 in Los Angeles, California. Nearly one hundred years later, the influence of this revival is not only still felt, but is continuing to increase. The seed of almost every subsequent revival, renewal, or reformation movement can be traced back to this point in the church?s history. Just as the pattern for a mature oak tree can be found in the genetic code of an acorn, the pattern for what the church is becoming can be seen in Azusa street. This is why it is so crucial for us to understand this revival.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Archetypal Medicine</h2><p>Dr. Ziegler re-reads asthma, skin disease, heart attacks, anorexia, rheumatism, and chronic pain from a psychological perspective.

He began his career with the <i>New York Herald Tribune</i> and has long been a freelance writer for leading magazines. During the 1970s he taught writing at Yale, where he was master of Branford College. From 1979 to 1987 he was general editor of the Book-of-the-Month Club. His 15 books, ranging from jazz to baseball, also include<i>Speaking of Journalism, American Places</i> and the influential <i>Writing to Learn</i>. He now teaches at the New School in New York, his hometown.Using numerous examples of clear, stylish writing from a broad range of disciplines, and adding the warmth of his personal experiences, Zinsser makes a strong case for his claim that writing about a field of knowledge is the best way to immerse oneself in it and to make it one's own. Three guiding principles emergeaccuracy, brevity, and clarityand, Zinsser argues, writers who keep them in mind will avoid much of the misunderstanding that results from bad writing. Zinnser has particularly harsh words for what he calls "corporation-speak," the incomprehensible nonsense that invades many professional publications.

Author Robert Paxton examines the Greenshirts in five case studies, throwing new light on French rural society and institutions during the Depression and on the emergence of a new rural leadership of authentic farmers. Paxton points out that fascism remained weak in the French countryside because the French state protected landowners more effectively than did those of Weimar Germany and Italy, and because French rural notables were so firmly embedded in social and economic power.<br><br>Although the Greenshirts disappeared with the Third Republic, they left a double legacy: a tradition of peasant direct action, which is still exercised today; and the idea of France as a peasant nation, whose identity and virtues rest upon the persistence of a large peasant sector. That self-image continues to influence French policy choices today, long after the social structure on which it rested has disappeared.<br></p><p>Though Robert O. Paxton entitles his book <i>French Peasant Fascism</i>, it soon becomes clear that the French peasant political movements of the 1930s were less about totalitarianism than about fair treatment for downtrodden farmers. Prior to World War II, France had the largest agricultural sector of the great industrial nations, yet farmers had very little government representation and no protections against the hardships of the Depression. Government indifference to rural concerns soon led Henry Dorg�res to organize the Greenshirts, a peasant group with all the outer trappings of a fascist organization--colored shirts, insignia, sacred oaths, and salutes--but with a far different political agenda. Paxton, well known for his studies of Vichy France, does a fine job of chronicling the rise and fall of the Greenshirts as well as the social, economic, and political conditions that gave birth to the group.<br><strong>Robert O.

I'm past my best -- &amp; therefore, of course, I am now celebrated.' </p><p> As Russell approached his fiftieth birthday, this was the kind of wittily self-deprecating remark he was prone to make. On this occasion he was speaking to Virginia Woolf, next to whom he found himself sitting on 3 December 1921 at a dinner party in Chelsea given by his old Cambridge friend (now a successful and wealthy barrister) Charles Sanger. Sitting among such friends, Russell could not help but be deeply conscious of the fact that he had changed a great deal since the days when he and Sanger had been mathematics students together thirty years earlier, and, under Virginia Woolf's gentle but persistent prompting ('Bertie is a fervid egoist,' Woolf wrote that night in her diary, 'which helps matters'), he began to reflect on these changes. He still regarded mathematics as 'the most exalted form of art', he told her, but it was not an art that he himself expected ever to practise again: 'The brain becomes rigid at 50 -- &amp; I shall be 50 in a month or two' (actually, he would be fifty the following May). He might write more philosophy, he said, but 'I have to make money', and so most of his writing would henceforth be paid journalism. The days when he could devote himself solely to serious intellectual work were over. Between the ages of twenty-eight and thirty-eight, he told Woolf, he had 'lived in a cellar &amp; worked', but then 'my passions got hold of me'. Now, he had come to terms with himself, and 'I don't expect any more emotional experiences. I don't think any longer that something is going to happen when I meet a new person.' </p><p> Virginia Woolf recorded all this in her diary without judgment or comment, but other friends noted the changes in Russell with dismay. At a dinner party two months later at the Webbs' home in Grosvenor Road, Russell was described by Beatrice Webb as 'cynical and witty', 'brilliantly intellectual' and yet 'not at peace either with himself or the world'. From a political point of view, she was inclined to regard him as a lightweight: 'He never seems serious, and his economic and political views follow on his temperamental likes and dislikes...He is too indolent or impatient to work out the problems of maximising freedom by deliberate social action.' All in all, she considered, he had gone downhill: </p><p> His present role of a fallen angel with Mephistophelian wit, and his brilliantly analytic and scoffing intellect, makes him stimulating company. All the same, I look back on this vision of an old friend with sadness. He may be successful as a <i>litt�rateur;</i> I doubt whether he will be of value as a thinker, and I am pretty well certain he will not attain happiness of love given and taken and the peacefulness of constructive work. When one remembers the Bertrand Russell of twenty years ago, with his intense concentration on abstract thought, his virile body and chivalrous ways, his comradeship and pleasant kindly humour, the perfect personal dignity with a touch of puritanism, it is melancholy to look at this rather frowsy, unhealthy and cynical personage, prematurely old, linked to a...girl of light character and materialist philosophy whom he does not and cannot reverence. </p><p> Beatrice Webb had always been a perceptive chronicler of Russell's changing personality, and this is an especially acute portrait, distorted to some extent, perhaps, by her loyalty to Alys, Russell's first wife, and her consequent dismissal of his second wife, Dora ('a singularly unattractive little person'), who, though half Alys's age, was, at twenty-seven, a little old to be called a 'girl'. </p><p> What is striking about these glimpses of Russell from the diaries of Virginia Woolf and Beatrice Webb is the sense they give of Russell's old friends needing in 1921 to catch up with the changes in his life and personality. Much had happened to him since the outbreak of war in 1914 that they had not been part of, and, since the end of the war, he had been out of the country for much of the time, first in Soviet Russia and then in China. Now he was back in their midst with a new wife, a new career as a journalist and public speaker and, in some fundamental respects, a new attitude to life. It is therefore no wonder that he seems to have spent much of his time with his friends reflecting on these changes, trying to explain what had happened to the Bertrand Russell they had known in the 1890s, the earnest, priggish young man, whose chief passion was the contemplation of the abstract truths of logic and mathematics. </p><p> Russell liked to say that his life before 1910 and his life after 1914 were as sharply separated as Faust's life before and after he met Mephistopheles. The First World War, he said, 'changed everything' for him, leaving him with a completely different, and much darker, view of human nature: 'I became convinced that most human beings are possessed by a profound unhappiness venting itself in destructive rages...I learned an understanding of instinctive processes which I had not possessed before.' But, as Russell himself often emphasised, in teaching him about the power of 'instinctive processes', the war had merely continued a transformation in his outlook and personality that had begun several years earlier with the release of his own instincts, triggered by his passionate love for Ottoline Morrell. Many of the changes in Russell noticed and lamented by Beatrice Webb were already apparent before the war started. The Russell who, in the spring Of 1914, inspired T. S. Eliot's 'Mr Apollinax' (reminding Eliot of 'Priapus in the shrubbery/Gaping at the lady in the swing'), would have been as unfamiliar a figure to Russell's friends of the 18gos as the 'fallen angel' described by Beatrice Webb in 1921. </p><p> By the early 1920s, the Russell described by Webb -- the cynical and witty <i>litt�rateur,</i> who had opinions on everything without ever thinking seriously about <i>anything</i> -- had become almost a stock figure in fiction. One recognises him as Mr Scogan in Aldous Huxley's <i>Crome Yellow,</i> Melian Stokes in Gilbert Cannan's <i>Pugs and Peacocks,</i> Joshua Malleson in D. H. Lawrence's <i>Women in Love,</i> and again as Bertie Reid in Lawrence's short story, 'The Blind Man'. What these caricatures (all written by people who knew Russell personally) have in common is their portrayal of a man who, though extraordinarily intelligent, had somehow lost his way; a fallen character who, having lost his faith in everything -- God, ideas, people -- had lost, too, any serious sense of purpose. Russell considered himself to have found, first in his love for Ottoline and then in his work for peace during the war, a higher, nobler purpose than that which had inspired his great work in mathematics, but this is not how it was perceived by others, who could not take him quite seriously, either as a lover or as a political reformer. In both roles he appeared incongruous and therefore a trivial, diminished figure compared to the intense, august and incontestably great author of <i>The Principles of Mathematics</i> and <i>Principia Mathematica.</i> Gilbert Cannan, for example, describes Melian Stokes as having, in his youth, 'achieved that obscure but illustrious fame which is given to mathematicians and men of science', and having then turned to politics, where the very qualities that made him a great mathematician and philosopher prove to be his undoing. It falls to his wise old aunt to tell him: </p><p> You are the same Melian with the difference only that you are working at a subject which the rest of us can reach, and the philosophic method in politics is, to say the least, alarming. You see, in politics, there is nothing to be proved. It is purely a matter of falling dexterously out of</p></p><h2>Barron&#39;s Anatomy Flash Cards, 2nd Edition</h2><p>This attractive, newly designed set of <i> Barron's Anatomy Flash Cards </i> makes an ideal study aid for med school students, nursing students, and health care trainees who are preparing for tests.

Since then, however, scientists working in this area have made remarkable progress, and an overall picture of how life emerged is coming more clearly into focus. We now know, for example, that the story of life's origin begins not on Earth, but in the interiors of distant stars. This book brings a summary of current research and ideas on life's origin to a wide audience. The contributors, all of whom received the Oparin/Urey Gold Medal of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life, are luminaries in the fields of chemistry, paleobiology, and astrobiology, and in these chapters they discuss their life's work: understanding the what, when, and how of the early evolution of life on Earth. Presented in nontechnical language and including a useful glossary of scientific terms, <i>Life's Origin </i>gives a state-of-the-art encapsulation of the fascinating work now being done by scientists as they begin to characterize life as a natural outcome of the evolution of cosmic matter.</p><p><b>J.

Precision, already a promiscuous term, seems now to have been uncoupled from its contract with truthfulness. Meanwhile error, and the always-political space of its dissent, has reconfigured itself.</p><p>In <i>The Architecture of Error</i> Francesca Hughes argues that behind the architect's acute fetishization of redundant precision lies a special fear of physical error. What if we were to consider the pivotal cultural and technological transformations of modernism to have been driven not so much by the causes its narratives declare, she asks, as by an unspoken horror of loss of control over error, material life, and everything that matter stands for? Hughes traces the rising intolerance of material vagaries&#x2015;from the removal of ornament to digitalized fabrication&#x2015;that produced the blind rejection of organic materials, the proliferation of material testing, and the rhetorical obstacles that blighted cybernetics. Why is it, she asks, that the more we cornered physical error, the more we feared it?</p><p>Hughes's analysis of redundant precision exposes an architecture of fear whose politics must be called into question. Proposing error as a new category for architectural thought, Hughes draws on other disciplines and practices that have interrogated precision and failure, citing the work of scientists Nancy Cartwright and Evelyn Fox Keller and visual artists Gordon Matta-Clark, Barbara Hepworth, Rachel Whiteread, and others. These non-architect practitioners, she argues, show that error need not be excluded and precision can be made accountable.</p></p><p>Francesca Hughes lives and works in London, where she taught at the Bartlett School of Architecture and the Architectural Association for many years. She is the editor of <i>The Architect: Reconstructing Her Practice</i> (MIT Press) and <i>Drawings That Count.</i><p>To err is human'&#x2015;but it is much more than that. In an original <i>tour de force</i> Francesca Hughes tells us that to be human is to err. While the Enlightenment tradition idealized humans and their creations by comparing them against rulers and straight edges, <i>The Architecture of Error</i> takes the reverse stance, seeing architecture, for the first time, entirely in <i>our</i> terms. The eternal quest for increased exactitude across fields appears as a receding mirage, leaving us with the sense that we have failed and have fallen. By rescuing the psycho-phenomenological from the confines of the mistaken and misshapen, Hughes offers us a model for how to build, live, and cope in the world of extreme precision science.</p>&#x2015;<b>Jimena Canales</b>, Thomas M. Siebel Chair in the History of Science, University of Illinois-UC; author of <i>A Tenth of a Second: A History</i><br><br><p>We have entered a Brave New World in which the messy intercourse between mind and material, with all its attendant unpredictability, has been replaced by the quest for ever-more-immaculately conceived buildings. In this remarkable book, Francesca Hughes illuminates the beauty of error's seduction and offers a way back to the subtle and precarious zones where contingency trumps precision, where architecture comes back to life.</p>&#x2015;<b>Jill Stoner</b>, Professor of Architecture, University of California, Berkeley; author of <i>Toward a Minor Architecture</i><br><br><p>In a relentlessly insightful and finely crafted analysis, Hughes shows how the architect's discourse on precision is congenitally imprecise.

He had published a volume of poetry (<i>The Marble Faun</i>), had written a few book reviews, and had contributed sketches to the University of Mississippi student newspaper. He had served a stint in the Royal Canadian Air Corps and while working in a New Haven bookstore had become acquainted with the wife of the writer Sherwood Anderson.</p><p> In his first six months in New Orleans, where the Andersons were living, Faulkner made his initial foray into serious fiction writing. Here in one volume are the pieces he wrote while in the French Quarter. These were published locally in the <i>Times-Picayune</i> and in the <i>Double Dealer</i>.</p><p> The pieces in <i>New Orleans Sketches</i> broadcast seeds that would take root in later works. In their themes and motifs these sketches and stories foreshadow the intense personal vision and style that would characterize Faulkner&#x2019;s mature fiction. As his sketches take on parallels with Christian liturgy and as they portray such characters as an idiot boy similar to Benjy Compson, they reveal evidence of his early literary sophistication.</p><p> In praise of <i>New Orleans Sketches</i>, Alfred Kazin wrote in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> that &#x201c;the interesting thing for us now, who can see in this book the outline of the writer Faulkner was to become, is that before he had published his first novel he had already determined certain main themes in his work.&#x201d;</p><p> In his trailblazing introduction, Carvel Collins often called &#x201c;Faulkner&#x2019;s best-informed critic,&#x201d; illuminates the period when the sketches were written as the time that Faulkner was making the transition from poet to novelist.</p><p> &#x201c;For the reader of Faulkner,&#x201d; Paul Engle wrote in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, &#x201c;the book is indispensable. Its brilliant introduction . . . is full both of helpful information . . . and of fine insights.&#x201d; &#x201c;We gain something more than a glimpse of the mind of a young genius asserting his power against a partially indifferent environment,&#x201d; states the <i>Book Exchange </i>(London). &#x201c;The long introduction . . . must rank as a major literary contribution to our knowledge of an outstanding writer: perhaps the greatest of our times.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Faulkner&#39;s early fictional forays that foreshadow a Nobel Laureate in the makingFaulkner&#39;s early fictional forays that foreshadow a Nobel laureate in the making|Faulkner&#39;s early fictional forays that foreshadow a Nobel Laureate in the making</p><h2>Biology Laboratory Manual</h2><p>This laboratory manual is designed for an introductory majors biology course with a broad survey of basic laboratory techniques.

From Superman and Batman to the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, these pop-culture juggernauts, with their "powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men," thrilled readers and audiences&#x2014;and simultaneously embodied a host of our dreams and fears about modern life and the onrushing future.<br><br>But that's just scratching the surface, says Jeffrey Kripal. In <i>Mutants and Mystics</i>, Kripal offers a brilliantly insightful account of how comic book heroes have helped their creators and fans alike explore and express a wealth of paranormal experiences ignored by mainstream science. Delving deeply into the work of major figures in the field&#x2014;from Jack Kirby&#x2019;s cosmic superhero sagas and Philip K. Dick&#x2019;s futuristic head-trips to Alan Moore&#x2019;s sex magic and Whitley Strieber&#x2019;s communion with visitors&#x2014;Kripal shows how creators turned to science fiction to convey the reality of the inexplicable and the paranormal they experienced in their lives. Expanded consciousness found its language in the metaphors of sci-fi&#x2014;incredible powers, unprecedented mutations, time-loops and vast intergalactic intelligences&#x2014;and the deeper influences of mythology and religion that these in turn drew from; the wildly creative work that followed caught the imaginations of millions. Moving deftly from Cold War science and Fredric Wertham's anticomics crusade to gnostic revelation and alien abduction, Kripal spins out a hidden history of American culture, rich with mythical themes and shot through with an awareness that there are other realities far beyond our everyday understanding.<br><br>A bravura performance, beautifully illustrated in full color throughout and brimming over with incredible personal stories, <i>Mutants and Mystics</i> is that rarest of things: a book that is guaranteed to broaden&#x2014;and maybe even blow&#x2014;your mind.</p><p><p><b>Jeffrey Kripal</b> is the J. Newton Rayzor Professor of Religion and chair of the Department of Religious Studies at Rice University. He is the author of six books, including <i>Esalen: America and the Religion of No Religion</i> and <i>Authors of the Impossible: The Paranormal and the Sacred</i>.</p><p>"An invigorating read, and a cross-cultural bonanza you never saw coming. Boldly embracing the enigmatic Id, Jeffrey Kripal has gathered the silver threads of grand mythologies, sacred texts, and mystical creeds, binding them to the visionary Super-Ego at the heart of modern literature&#x2019;s bastard sons--comic books and science fiction."</p> (Barry Windsor-Smith)<br><br><p>"<i>Mutants and Mystics</i> chronicles the emergence of a complex and startlingly dangerous energy in our world.&nbsp; Because we don't know what it is, we identify it as paranormal. But perhaps what it should really be called is 'abnormally powerful,' for, as Jeff Kripal reveals with satisfying skill in this book, it has come to define the very essence of the popular imagination. Instead of fairies and sylphs and gorgons, our rationalist world is defied by a folklore of superheroes, supervillains, and dangerous strangers, and, as I know all too well, can be shattered by them in some very real ways. <i>Mutants and Mystics</i> is the first book that shines the light of reason and insight into this swarming forest. As a wanderer here, I found the light that poured from these pages as blessed as it is breathtaking."</p> (Whitley Strieber, author of Communion)<br><br><p>"For most of the history of popular culture, the creators and the academics--the storytellers and the scholars--have sat in different rooms, in different houses, virtually on different worlds, having virtually no contact with each other.&nbsp;Even when the professors began to discover the secret, inner meanings and contexts of B-movies and comic books and science-fiction pulps, there was little contact between the classroom and the creators.&nbsp; Now, however, Jeffrey J.&nbsp;Kripal has come along--both analyst and&nbsp;aficionado, examiner and enthusiast. He bridges the gap between spirituality and its sometimes seedy&nbsp;outcroppings in&nbsp;pop culture, and&nbsp;forges&#x2014;or rather, <i>reveals</i><i>--</i>a synthesis that was really there all along, if so many guys with PhD&#x2019;s hadn't had a vested interest in not recognizing it.&nbsp;More power to him, I say!&nbsp;Or rather--more <i>super-</i>power!"</p> (Roy Thomas, writer of The Uncanny X-Men, Fantastic Four , The Incredible Hulk , and more)<br><br><p>"Jeffrey Kripal is not only serious about some very strange stuff in <i>Mutants and Mystics</i>, he is seriously smart and singularly thought-provoking about it.&nbsp;Trust me, I've been there and this book is an excellent guide, maybe even a new map of mysterious terrain first charted in antiquity.&nbsp;Always scholarly yet never stuffy, always fun but never superficial, <i>Mutants and Mystics</i> makes a solid case for contemplating ancient myth as secret (if garbled) history and demonstrates how that myth/history is perpetuated in pop culture, whether today's creators are fully aware of what they're doing or not."</p> (Doug Moench, author of Batman and The Big Book of the Unexplained)<br><br>"The message is that we need to step backwards from our culture to see these hidden patterns, and in this endeavor Kripal provides new maps of the secret world of superpowers. To access these deep strata of reality and to achieve a measure of self-realisation, we need to embrace this strangeness and not be frightened of it. . . . Kripal has a lively style and a deep love of (perhaps reverence for) his subject matter." (<i>Fortean Times</i>)<br><br>"Intriguing."

While some publishers have opted to apply OCR (optical character recognition) technology to the process, we believe this leads to sub-optimal results (frequent typographical errors, strange characters and confusing formatting) and does not adequately preserve the historical character of the original artifact. We believe this work is culturally important in its original archival form. While we strive to adequately clean and digitally enhance the original work, there are occasionally instances where imperfections such as blurred or missing pages, poor pictures or errant marks may have been introduced due to either the quality of the original work or the scanning process itself. Despite these occasional imperfections, we have brought it back into print as part of our ongoing global book preservation commitment, providing customers with access to the best possible historical reprints. We appreciate your understanding of these occasional imperfections, and sincerely hope you enjoy seeing the book in a format as close as possible to that intended by the original publisher.</p><p>Initially banned in France by King Louis, Moli re's celebrated social satire Tartuffe exposes false piety and hypocrisy in the Catholic Church.

Because the range of works taught in world literature courses has expanded enormously, both historically and geographically, the task of selection--and of teacher preparation--has grown more challenging. Teachers of this field must grapple with such issues as coverage, cultural difference, and the role of translation in the classroom. Should one emphasize masterpieces or traditions, concepts or themes? How does one avoid making a work bear the burden of representing an entire tradition? To what extent should anthologies be used? Can a course be global in scope and yet focus on a few works, authors, moments?<p>This collection of thirty-two essays in the MLA series Options for Teaching offers an array of solutions to these challenges, reflecting the wide variety of institutions, courses, and students described by the contributors.

Why have multiple U.S. efforts to create a stable democracy in Haiti failed so spectacularly? Philippe Girard answers these and other questions, examining how colonialism and slavery have left a legacy of racial tension, both within Haiti and internationally; Haitians remain deeply suspicious of white foriegners' motives, many of whom doubt Hatians' ability to govern themselves. He also examines how Haiti's current political instability is merely a continuation of political strife that began during the War of Independence (1791-1804). Finally, in <i>Haiti: The Tumultuous History,</i> Girard explores poverty's devastating impact on contemporary Haiti and argues that Haitians--particularly home-grown dictators--bear a big share of the responsibility for their nation's troubles.</p><p><b>Philippe Girard</b> is an Assistant Professor of Caribbean History, McNeese State University of Louisiana.

Until Clinton administration classified documents become available this will remain the standard account and an object lesson for all future American cut-and-run attempts at peace-keeping and nation-building.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Joan Hoff, Montana State University, Bozeman on Clinton in Haiti</i></p><p>&#x201c;Written by an outstanding young French scholar of recent American history, this examination of U.S. intervention in Haiti under Bill Clinton probes the motivations behind an unnecessary military action and explains the ways in which objective failure is translated into political success.

As new developments in drug sales and trafficking drove profits, and established criminal control loosened or crumbled, others saw the opportunity and lunged for it. If the Asian triads, Hells Angels and Indo-Canadian Mafia represented the old school of organizations drawn largely on cultural and ethnic lines, the new school was represented by the inclusive opportunists of the United Nations, Red Scorpions, Independent Soldiers and others attracted by the idea of easy money and a little violence. Among those drawn into the underworld were three brothers, Jonathan, Jarrod and Jamie Bacon.</p><p>Infamous and seemingly untouchable, the Bacon Brothers publicly lived the successful gangster lifestyle to a tee, with flashy cars, jewelry and a serious reputation for violence. What was unusual was their comfortable, middle-class upbringing and stable family life&#x2014;rather than being left with no option but crime, they seemed to have made a conscious decision to step outside the law. Unfortunately for them, nothing in the criminal underworld is permanent, and shifting alliances, rivalries and police work eventually caught up with each of them.</p><p>In <i>The Notorious Bacon Brothers</i>, bestselling author<i> </i>Jerry Langton tells the story of the new drug trade in BC, of betrayals and retributions, of public shootouts and assassinations, and of innocent bystanders caught in the middle.</p><p><b>JERRY LANGTON</b> is a journalist and the author of several books, including the national bestsellers <i>Fallen Angel: The Unlikely Rise of Walter Stadnick in the Canadian Hells Angels; Showdown: How the Outlaws, Hells Angels and Cops Fought for Control of the Streets</i> and <i>Gangland: The Rise of the Mexican Cartels from El Paso to Vancouver</i>.

Refuting the rationales for our lack of attention to the problem and contradicting some commonly held beliefs about sexual abuse, it combines accounts from survivors with input from professionals working with both survivors and abusers.<br><br>Part I presents contributions from professionals who discuss aspects of female sexual abuse ranging from impact and treatment issues for victims of childhood sexual abuse by female perpetrators to the paradox of women who sexually abuse children. The second part is devoted to survivors--it presents stories from both men and women, then provides self-help guidelines for both. The book concludes with a valuable section on resources which includes a review of the existing literature on female child molestation as well as a listing of pertinent books and help organizations.<br><br>FEMALE SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN also addresses the controversial issue of current statistics that show that female sexual abuse is very rare and the question of whether it is being underreported due to fear from survivors that they will not be believed or supported. Regardless of the true magnitude of this problem, secrecy or denial about any aspect of child abuse must be avoided. Whatever future studies may show about this problem, it will not diminish this book's importance in taking the step of exploring this issue.<br></p><p>Michele Elliot is a Child Psychologist and founder and Director of the children's protection agency KIDSCAPE, in London, UK.

Michele Elliott and her colleagues guide us through denial, stereotypes, and conventional misinformation to an unflinching examination of painful realities. Theoretical, research and clinical chapters help to forge a new understanding of the issues and set directions for further exploration. Many survivors, both male and female, will finally have their experiences validated. The powerfully moving survivors' stories will be vital tools for survivors in their healing and will aid therapists in understanding the complexities of recovery from sexual abuse by females." --Mike Lew, author of <i>Victims No Longer: Men Recovering From Incest and Other Sexual Child Abuse</i> <br><br>"Michele Elliott has done a splendid job compiling information from a variety of sources in regard to sexual abuse by female perpetrators.

Imperial representations laid the ground for the epistemological transformations of the so-called Scientific Revolutions. The patriotic narratives lie at the core of the first modern representations of the racialized body, Humboldtian theories of biodistribution, and views of the landscape as a historical text representing different layers of historical memory.</p><p>&#x201c;Pathbreaking and provocative throughout, Nature, Empire, and Nation represents revisionist history at its best.

The development of interpretive modes of various stripes&#x2014;post-structuralist, Marxian, phenomenological, psychoanalytic, as well as others dissenting or eccentric&#x2014;has given scholars a range of tools for rethinking architecture in relation to other fields and for reasserting architectures general importance in intellectual discourse.<br> <br> This anthology presents forty-seven of the primary texts of architecture theory, introducing each with an explication of the concepts and categories necessary for its understanding and evaluation. It also presents twelve documents of projects or events that had major theoretical repercussions for the period.

Here, successive groups of pioneers built new societies and developed new institutions to cope with life in the wilderness. In this thorough revision of his classic account, Malcolm J. Rohrbough tells the dramatic story of these men and women from the first Kentucky settlements to the closing of the frontier. Rohrbough divides his narrative into major time periods designed to establish categories of description and analysis, presenting case studies that focus on the county, the town, the community, and the family, as well as politics and urbanization. He also addresses Spanish, French, and Native American traditions and the anomalous presence of African slaves in the making of this story.</p><p>&#34;The definitive history of the subject. Nothing approaches it in the scope of its coverage. I can think of no other book more frequently cited . . . on the conquest, settlement, and development of the region between the Appalachians and the Great Plains.

Jane is abused by her aunt and cousin and then attends a harsh charity school. Through it all she remains strong and determinedly refuses to allow a cruel world to crush her independence or her strength of will. A masterful story of a woman&#39;s quest for freedom and love.

Published in 1847, under the pseudonym of Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine--one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect and tireless perseverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved.

For the past thirty years, scholars of language and gender have been debating and developing Lakoff's initial observations.<br><br>Arguing that language is fundamental to gender inequality, Lakoff pointed to two areas in which inequalities can be found: Language used about women, such as the asymmetries between seemingly parallel terms like <em>master</em> and <em>mistress</em>, and language used by women, which places women in a double bind between being appropriately feminine and being fully human. Lakoff's central argument that "women's language" expresses powerlessness triggered a controversy that continues to this day.<br><br>The revised and expanded edition presents the full text of the original first edition, along with an introduction and annotations by Lakoff in which she reflects on the text a quarter century later and expands on some of the most widely discussed issues it raises. The volume also brings together commentaries from twenty-six leading scholars of language, gender, and sexuality, within linguistics, anthropology, modern languages, education, information sciences, and other disciplines.

The central character is a dog named Buck. The story opens at a ranch in the Santa Clara Valley of California when Buck is stolen from his home and sold into service as a sled dog in Alaska. He progressively reverts to a wild state in the harsh climate, where he is forced to fight to dominate other dogs. By the end, he sheds the veneer of civilization and relies on primordial instinct and learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild.<br><br> London spent almost a year in the Yukon collecting material for the book. The story was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post in the summer of 1903; it was published a month later in book form. The book's great popularity and success made a reputation for London. Much of its appeal derives from its simplicity as a tale of survival. As early as 1923, the story was adapted to film, and it has since seen several more cinematic adaptations.</p><p>&#34;A lively and expressive reading of this riveting story of the far north.&#34;<p> A best-seller from its first publication in 1903, <em>The Call of the Wild</em> tells the story of Buck, a big mongrel dog who is shipped from his comfortable life in California to Alaska, where he must adapt to the harsh life of a sled dog during the Klondike Gold Rush. The narrative recounts Buck&#x2019;s brutal obedience training, his struggle to meet the demands of human masters, and his rise to the position of lead sled dog as a result of his superior physical and mental qualities. Finally, Buck is free to respond to the &#x201c;call&#x201d; of the wilderness. Over a hundred years after its publication, Jack London&#x2019;s &#x201c;dog story&#x201d; retains the enduring appeal of a classic. </p> <p> This Broadview Edition includes a critical introduction that explores London&#x2019;s life and legacy and the complex scientific and psychological ideas drawn upon by London in writing the story. The appendices include material on the Klondike, Darwin&#x2019;s writings on dogs, other contemporary writings on instinct and atavism, and maps of the regions in which the story takes place. </p></p><h2>Heinrich Boll: Eighteen Stories (English and German Edition)</h2><p>Portraits of highly diverse characters explore a wide range of human experience and emotion</p><p></p><h2>Essentials of Development Economics</h2><p>Written to provide students with the critical tools used in today&#x2019;s development economics research and practice, <i>Essentials of Development Economics</i> represents an alternative approach to traditional textbooks on the subject.

Celebrated economist George Ayittey thinks the answer is obvious: economic freedom was denied to them, first by foreign colonial powers and now by indigenous leaders with similarly oppressive practices. As war and conflict replaced peace, Africa's infrastructure crumbled. Instead of bemoaning the myriad difficulties facing the continent today, Ayittey boldly proposes a program of development--a way forward--for Africa. <i>Africa Unchained</i> investigates how Africa can modernize, build, and improve its indigenous institutions, and argues forcefully that Africa should build and expand upon traditions of free markets and free trade rather than continuing to use exploitative economic structures. The economic model here is uniquely African and takes little heed from the developed world; this is sure to be a highly controversial plan for moving Africa forward.</p><p><b>George Ayittey</b> is Distinguished Economist in Residence at George Washington University.

In this collection of essays, speeches, and letters, Beckmann emerges as a deeply intelligent and sensitive observer of the world. Of particular note are writings from the battlefields of 1915, and some of his instructional comments to students from his time spent teaching in the United States in the late 1940s.One of the most important German artists of the twentieth century, Max Beckmann was labeled a &#34;degenerate artist&#34; by the Nazis and chose exile. His artistic production encompassed the realism and figural themes of his early works to the provocatively blunt portraiture, critical urban views, and richly layered symbolic works for which he is now universally recognized. Although he was a prolific writer, his written work has never before been collected and translated into English. Beckmann is known for the depth, pungency, and tremendous sensuous force of his works; only in the last twenty years have we come to learn more about his personal life. Self-Portrait in Words maps out Beckmann&#39;s life and draws attention to the occasions on or for which he produced his writings, to the importance writing had for him as a form of expression, and to both the contemporary and personal references of his ideas and images.</p><h2>Remixing the Classroom: Toward an Open Philosophy of Music Education (Counterpoints: Music and Education)</h2><p><p>In a delightfully self-conscious philosophical "mash-up," Randall Everett Allsup provides alternatives for the traditional master-apprentice teaching model that has characterized music education. By providing examples across the arts and humanities, Allsup promotes a vision of education that is open, changing, and adventurous at heart. He contends that the imperative of growth at the core of all teaching and learning relationships is made richer, though less certain, when it is fused with a student's self-initiated quest. In this way, the formal study of music turns from an education in teacher-directed craft and moves into much larger and more complicated fields of exploration. Through vivid stories and evocative prose, Randall Everett Allsup advocates for an open, quest-driven teaching model that has repercussions for music education and the humanities more generally.</p></p><p><p>Randall Everett Allsup is Associate Professor and Coordinator of Music Education at Teachers College Columbia University.

VERDICT Both a solid research tool and an enjoyable read, this is a worthwhile purchase for nonfiction collections.&#x2014;Casey O'Leary, Mooresville Public Library, IN</p><h2>Which Side Are You on?: Trying to Be for Labor When It&#39;s Flat on Its Back</h2><p>When it first appeared in hardcover, Which Side Are You On? received widespread critical accolades, and was nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award for nonfiction. In this new paperback edition, Thomas Geoghegan has updated his eloquent plea for the relevance of organized labor in America with an afterword covering the labor movement through the 1990s. A funny, sharp, unsentimental career memoir, Which Side Are You On? pairs a compelling history of the rise and near-fall of labor in the United States with an idealist&#39;s disgruntled exercise in self-evaluation. Writing with the honesty of an embattled veteran still hoping for the best, Geoghegan offers an entertaining, accessible, and literary introduction to the labor movement, as well as an indispensable touchstone for anyone whose hopes have run up against the unaccommodating facts on the ground. Wry and inspiring, Which Side Are You On? is the ideal book for anyone who has ever woken up and realized, &#34;You must change your life.&#34;</p><p><b>Thomas Geoghegan</b>'s essays and commentary have appeared in the <i>Chicago Tribune, the Nation, the New Republic, the New York Times, Slate,</i> and the <i>Washington Post,</i> among other publications. His other books are <i>The Secret Lives of Citizens</i> and <i>In America's Court</i>. Geoghegan is a practicing attorney in Chicago.A heartfelt and worthy study by labor-attorney Geoghegan of what it means to be on the side of organized labor at a time when labor is written off as an ancient relic. This is not simply a rhetorical plea that Americans need strong unions if the divide between rich and poor that began to grow again in the 1980's is not to grow wider. Geoghegan also believes that a strong labor movement would serve to democratize American politics and life. From his experience as an observer for the dissident faction in a United Mine Workers election in the 1970's to his defense of steelworkers who were stripped of their pension rights in the 1980's, Geoghegan explores the reality of present day industrial relations from his perch as an independent labor lawyer. What he finds is a stale and fearful trade-union leadership that has succumbed to the lawyers it hired to navigate the nation's labor laws and that has refused to allow its own members to vote for their leadership. The author forcefully depicts the devastation of the American working class caused by the captains of finance, who through leveraged takeovers and buyouts hastened the decline of American industry in the 1980's. Throughout, Geoghegan's skepticism about his own career is tempered by the dignity of rank-and-file workers who seek to have a say in their own lives. Geoghegan has managed to take a little discussed subject--the role of a vital labor movement in American society--and place it at the center of a discussion about the growing class-divide in American society. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Clear and comprehensive, it &#34;demystifies&#34; one of the world&#39;s most important and least understood institutions. Roy H. Ginsberg contextualizes European integration through the foundation blocks of history, law, economics, and politics. He then breaks the Eu down into its components so that they can be understood individually and in relation to the whole. Reconstructing the Eu as a single polity, Ginsberg evaluates the Eu&#39;s domestic and foreign policies and their effects on Europeans and non-Europeans alike. The author thus challenges students to see what the European Union truly represents: a unique experiment in regional cooperation and a remarkable model of conflict resolution for the world&#39;s troubled regions.</p><p><b>Roy H. Ginsberg</b> is Jean Monnet Chair in European Integration Studies and Joseph C. Palamountain, Jr. Chair in Government at Skidmore College.Currently, the EU is confronted with dramatic financial challenges testing the endurance of its foundations. While some may question the prospects of a stable EU and even foresee disintegration, the logic underpinning its regional integration endures. Ginsberg offers a comprehensive overview of the EU along with a wealth of informative charts and tables as well as thought-provoking study questions that ultimately underscore the enduring logic of regional integration in this easily accessible, detailed-oriented second edition of a textbook designed for students taking courses on European integration. Bound by shared geography, history, religions, economy, and civilization, the EU is not an accident of history but a history of dialectical unity and disunity. Accordingly, the comprehensive overview begins with a historical perspective of the EU that spans 2,000 years and then turns to the political thought and political theory associated with European integration. In addition to examining the legal and economic foundations of the EU, the volume, from a policy-making perspective, continues with a detailed explanation of the decision-making processes and the relevant political institutions and concludes with a discussion and assessment of policy outcomes.

Looking at Britain, the United States, and Japan from the nineteenth century to the present, he explains changes in their status as industrial superpowers. Lazonick stresses the importance for industrial leadership of cooperative relations between employers and shop-floor workers. Such relations permit employers to use new technologies to their maximum potential, which in turn transforms the high fixed costs inherent in these technologies into low unit costs and large market shares. Cooperative relations can also lead employers to invest in the skills of workers themselves--skills that enable shop-floor workers to influence quality as well as quantity of production. </p><p> </p><p> To build cooperative shop-floor relations, successful employers have been willing to pay workers higher wages than they could have secured elsewhere in the economy. They have also been willing to offer workers long-term employment security. These policies, Lazonick argues, have not come at the expense of profits but rather have been a precondition for making profits. </p><p> </p><p> Focusing particularly on the role of labor-management relations in fostering "flexible mass production" in Japan since the 1950s, Lazonick criticizes those economists and politicians who, in the face of the Japanese challenge, would rely on free markets alone to restore the international competitiveness of industry in Britain and the United States. </p></p><p></p><h2>This is Not a Maths Book A Graphic Activity Book /anglais</h2><p>This is Not a Maths Book</p><p>Anna Weltman is an author and math teacher, with a passion for showing kids how math is present in the world all around us.

A growing body of evidence has proven that its current cornerstone&#x2015;incentives to attract and retain large, globally mobile businesses&#x2015;is a dead end. Even those programs that focus on local business, through buy-local initiatives, for example, depend on ongoing support from government or philanthropy. The entire practice of economic development has become ineffective and unaffordable and is in need of a makeover.&nbsp;<br> <br> <em>The Local Economy Solution</em> suggests an alternative approach in which states and cities nurture a new generation of special kinds of businesses that help local businesses grow. These cutting-edge companies, which Shuman calls &#x201c;pollinator businesses,&#x201d; are creating jobs and the conditions for future economic growth, and doing so in self-financing ways.&nbsp;<br> <br> Pollinator businesses are especially important to communities that are struggling to lift themselves up in a period of economic austerity, when municipal budgets are being slashed. They also promote locally owned businesses that increase local self-reliance and evince high labor and environmental standards.&nbsp;<br> <br> The book includes nearly two dozen case studies of successful pollinator businesses that are creatively facilitating business and neighborhood improvements, entrepreneurship, local purchasing, local investing, and profitable business partnerships. Examples include Main Street Genome (which provides invaluable data to improve local business performance), Supportland (which is developing a powerful loyalty card for local businesses), and Fledge (a business accelerator that finances itself through royalty payments). It also shows how the right kinds of public policy can encourage the spread of pollinator businesses at virtually no cost.</p></p><p><p>Michael H.

This most recent book is a practical overview of how to generate economic development without selling one's soul to big government and philanthropies. Shuman developed the book from interviews he conducted in 2014 with entrepreneurs who headed up 36 &#x2018;pollinators,' defined as 'self-financing enterprise[s] committed to boosting local business.&#x2019; A pollinator allows a community to take on key economic development functions: identifying opportunities for local businesses (the planning), fostering buy efforts (the purchasing), training locals for business opportunities (the people), showing how local businesses can work together (the partnerships), and finding how local capital can be mobilized to expand local businesses more cost-effectively than taxpayer-funded programs can (the purse). Shuman urges readers and their friends to form local investment clubs; such clubs essentially make members part of the solution because they help those interested in joining the movement move away from 'legalized bribery,' such as offering companies tax breaks to abandon their hometowns. Taken as a whole, this book presents an engaging story of the emerging localization movement by describing real people and enterprises doing real development. <strong>Summing Up</strong>: Recommended. Lower-division undergraduates through professionals and practitioners.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><em><strong>Kirkus Reviews-</strong></em></p> <p>"An argument against bringing large corporations to local communities through tax incentives and grants, an approach the author claims is destructive to employment and investment. Shuman (Local Dollars, Local Sense: How to Move Your Money From Wall Street to Main Street and Achieve Real Prosperity, 2012, etc.), a longtime advocate for promoting local business and a former director of the Business Alliance For Local Living Economies, asserts that "economic development today is completely broken." Citing the 750-fold increase in subsidies for the movie industry over the past decade, the author debunks the myths circulated to support attracting business in this way, and he argues that such deals do not create jobs but rather take more money out of communities than they bring in. He insists that "those who win the investment lose" and that "it's high time for economic developers to get back to business." Shuman views local startup businesses as the answer, especially the kind he calls "pollinators." These measure success more broadly than by direct returns and include significant contributions to their community and other local businesses. This approach is intended to strengthen a core feature of the current economy. "All companies that matter," he writes, "are not globally mobile." More than half are not spreading across the world but are locally owned and unlikely to move. U.S. capital markets do not often invest in local businesses. Self-financing local "pollinators" address this "huge capital market failure." Shuman believes that planners should focus on the potentials within their areas through the accumulation of the detailed knowledge necessary, and he provides ways to measure opportunities lost and potential foregone. He also discusses profiles from several cities and counties to exemplify ways in which local businesses are being promoted. These include Sustainable Connections in Bellingham, Washington, and Local First Arizona, among others.

Just as fundamental as faith in the free market is the belief that government has a legitimate and competent role in policing and the punishment arena. This curious incendiary combination of free market efficiency and the Big Brother state has become seemingly obvious, but it hinges on the illusion of a supposedly natural order in the economic realm. <i>The Illusion of Free Markets</i> argues that our faith in &#x201c;free markets&#x201d; has severely distorted American politics and punishment practices. </p><p> </p><p> <b>Bernard Harcourt</b> traces the birth of the idea of natural order to eighteenth-century economic thought and reveals its gradual evolution through the Chicago School of economics and ultimately into today&#x2019;s myth of the free market. The modern category of &#x201c;liberty&#x201d; emerged in reaction to an earlier, integrated vision of punishment and public economy, known in the eighteenth century as &#x201c;police.&#x201d; This development shaped the dominant belief today that competitive markets are inherently efficient and should be sharply demarcated from a government-run penal sphere. </p><p> </p><p> This modern vision rests on a simple but devastating illusion. Superimposing the political categories of &#x201c;freedom&#x201d; or &#x201c;discipline&#x201d; on forms of market organization has the unfortunate effect of obscuring rather than enlightening. It obscures by making both the free market and the prison system seem natural and necessary. In the process, it facilitated the birth of the penitentiary system in the nineteenth century and its ultimate culmination into mass incarceration today. </p></p><p>Bernard Harcourt is Julius Kreeger Professor of Law and Criminology and Professor and Chairman of the Department of Political Science at University of Chicago.<i>The Illusion of Free Markets</i> is a beautifully written and well-researched book that addresses two subjects of great contemporary significance: the conceptualization of market exchange as "free" and "natural," and the expansion of the American penal system. The book argues that the way we think about markets has shaped&#x2014;indeed, distorted&#x2014;the way we think about criminal justice, and it is time to rethink both. Harcourt's claims will spur lively and much needed debate. (Alice Ristroph, Seton Hall University)<br><br>Bernard Harcourt has never had an uninteresting thought, or made an argument that does not provoke or engage or delight or enlighten&#x2014;or do all of those things simultaneously. (Best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell)<br><br>Bernard Harcourt has two urgent lessons to teach. The first is that there are no "free" markets, only markets regulated in different ways and by different means. The second is that libertarian devotion to free markets tends to march in step with authoritarian devotion to coercion, the punitive carceral state. This brilliant book, beautifully written and illustrated with a wealth of fascinating detail -- is a subtle and penetrating study of the origins and development of some of our principal modern illusions. (Robert W. Gordon, Yale University)<br><br>Bernard Harcourt's magisterial book makes a strong and persuasive case for the tight connection of the invisible hand of neoliberal 'free' markets and the iron fist of carceral policies. His erudite blend of history, political thought and economic theory lays bare the dark side of neoliberal penality. We ignore his powerful democratic voice and view at our own peril! (Cornel West, author of Democracy Matters and Race Matters)<br><br>In this intrepid book, Harcourt excavates the historical genealogy of the twin myths of the 'free market' and the 'diligent police' to illumine the current American predicament of steep social inequality and gargantuan prisons. From Quesnay to Bentham to Ronald Coase and Gary Becker, he reveals that the current idolatry of the market finds its roots in successive declinations of the eighteenth-century notion of 'natural order,' which fosters both minimal government in economic matters and maximal government in law and order. By retracing how market naturalism and penal despotism come to form the two sides of the same conception of the state, <i>The Illusions of Free Markets</i> offers a bracing critique of neoliberal reason that will stimulate wide debate and heated controversy. (Lo�c Wacquant, author of Punishing the Poor: The Neoliberal Government of Social Insecurity)<br><br>An ambitious and sophisticated exploration of the ideological roots of what might well be the central paradox of modern American culture -- that we insist that we are the leaders of the 'free world' while incarcerating more people per capita than any other country on the planet. (David Cole, Georgetown University)<br><br><i>The Illusion of Free Markets</i> explores the concept of natural order that underlies so much of free market economic thought&#x2014;particularly the Chicago School. Bernard Harcourt's insights into how our economic rhetoric influences the United States' acceptance of incarceration are particularly rich. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to think seriously about those two natural antagonists: markets and democracy. (Lester Thurow, author of Head to Head, The Future of Capitalism, and The Zero-Sum Society)<br><br>Not only is the "free" market of laissez-faire doctrine not free, it underpins the extravagant unfreedom of our metastasized penal system, argues this provocative intellectual history...The author mounts an incisive attack on the association of markets with freedom and government with repression...The result is a stimulating challenge to conventional wisdom.

In "Rip Van Winkle," a henpecked husband escapes his nagging wife by wandering the Catskills, where he encounters some mysterious mountain men and tastes a strange brew with unexpected effects.

He argues that interwar France must be understood as an imperial nation-state&#x2014;an integrated sociopolitical system that linked a parliamentary republic to an administrative empire. An interdisciplinary study of colonial modernity combining French history, colonial studies, and social theory, <i>The French Imperial Nation-State</i> will compel readers to revise conventional assumptions about the distinctions between republicanism and racism, metropolitan and colonial societies, and national and transnational processes.</p></p><p><b>Gary Wilder</b> is associate professor of history at Pomona College. <br><p>&#x201c;In this strikingly original work, Gary Wilder combines archival research, political theory, and literary analysis to issue a decisive challenge to reigning approaches to the study of French history.

Starting from an interest in French colonial history, Wilder seeks to reframe the way we think about the history of modern France as a whole. The author lays out a sophisticated theoretical framework that is both original and well grounded in several intellectual fields.&#x201d;--Tyler Stovall, University of California, Berkeley</p><p></p> (Tyler Stovall)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Gary Wilder&#x2019;s historical anthropology of the French imperial nation-state is the work of a truly gifted scholar. It evinces quite an extraordinary mix of imagination, critical acuity, theoretical subtlety, and empirical depth.

Meticulous in its detail, provocative, and imaginative in its interpretations, it identifies the key issues of administration, government, and citizenship to illuminate the cross-cutting currents that shaped both France and her African colonial empire.&#x201d;</p> (Mamadou Diouf, University of Michigan)<br><br>"Wilder's trenchant and insightful book will be of considerable interest to scholars of French and African history, particularly in the subfields of intellectual, cultural, and political history." (Elizabeth Schmidt <i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>"Wilder focuses on broad themes rather than furnishing a detailed case study, but his method of analysis will be of practical benefit to historians exploring interactions within the imperial nation-state, and will be excellent for use in graduate seminars on imperialism and French colonialism." (Jeremy McMaster Rich <i>Itinerario</i>)<br><br>"Wilder has fashioned an argument that 'empricist historians' will not find easy to dismantle, and this complex book deserves their engagement." (Owen White <i>Journal of Colonialsm and Colonial History</i>)<br><br>"This remarkably original and groundbreaking study renews and enriches our understanding of the interwar Negritude movement and its historical context. The volume's wide-ranging interdisciplinary scope combines archival research, critical theory, and literary analysis to powerful effect. Gary Wilder surpasses all previous studies of Negritude in his scrupulous and theoretically resonant inquiry." (Nick Nesbitt <i>New West Indian Guide</i>)<br><br>"Wilder's careful and thorough analysis of the long-term development of the French welfare state as well as its subsidiary colonial administration . . . is a must-read. . . . A boon for anyone whose knowledge of France and its colonies comes laargely from film and literature that were generated by the colonized." (Jacqueline Thomas <i>French Review</i>)</p><h2>The Splendor of Islamic Calligraphy</h2><p>Calligraphy, the art that combines visual image and written word, is perhaps at its most brilliant in the arts of Islam. Islamic calligraphy traditionally took its inspiration from the Muslim belief in the divine origin of Arabic writing, the medium through which the Qur'anic revelation to the Prophet Muhammad was recorded. In early Islam the use of Arabic writing is sacred, and official texts gave rise to a wonderful profusion of scripts and a calligraphic tradition that has flourished for over a thousand yearsnot only in manuscript decoration but in architecture, ceramics, and painting. With chapters on the use of calligraphy in architecture and contemporary painting, <i>The Splendor of Islamic Calligraphy</i> provides a comprehensive and fascinating survey of the subject from its earliest origins to the present day. It explains the geometrical and ornamental principles of calligraphy with the help of numerous line drawings, and examines the interdependence of script and page decoration. It gives an overview of the many complex variations of this most graphic form of writing and traces its evolution up to its current expression in the paintings of artists such as Shakir Hassan. Finally, and perhaps most important, it contains outstanding examples of scripts<i>kufic, thuluth, naskhi</i>, and <i>maghribi</i> among othersin a series of magnificent reproductions of manuscript pages, paintings, and other works of art. 232 illustrations, 98 in color.</p><p><b>Abdelkebir Khatibi,</b> professor at the Mohammed V University, Rabat, and <b>Mohammed Sijelmasi</b>, a noted art critic, have published books on a variety of subjects associated with Islamic culture and, in particular, the arts of Morocco.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Business Finance (DECA)</h2><p>BUSINESS FINANCE presents finance from a business point of view.

The black panther has black feet. Black feet on the crumbling black panther. Pan-thuh. Mee-dah. Pam Stacy, 16 years old, a cute girl here in La Jolla, California, with a pair of orange bell-bottom hip-huggers on, sits on a step about four steps down the stairway to the beach and she can see a pair of revolting black feet without lifting her head. So she says it out loud, "The black panther."<br><br>Somebody farther down the stairs, one of the boys with the major hair and khaki shorts, says, "The black feet of the black panther."<br><br>"Mee-dah," says another kid. This happens to be the cry of a, well, underground society known as the Mac Meda Destruction Company.<br><br>"The pan-thuh."<br><br>"The poon-thuh."<br><br>All these kids, seventeen of them, members of the Pump House crowd, are lollygagging around the stairs down to Windansea Beach, La Jolla, California, about 11 a.m., and they all look at the black feet, which are a woman's pair of black street shoes, out of which stick a pair of old veiny white ankles, which lead up like a senile cone to a fudge of tallowy, edematous flesh, her thighs, squeezing out of her bathing suit, with old faded yellow bruises on them, which she probably got from running eight feet to catch a bus or something. She is standing with her old work-a-hubby, who has on sandals: you know, a pair of navy-blue anklet socks and these sandals with big, wide, new-smelling tan straps going this way and that, for keeps. Man, they look like orthopedic sandals, if one can imagine that. Obviously, these people come from Tucson or Albuquerque or one of those hincty adobe towns. All these hincty, crumbling black feet come to La Jolla-by-the-sea from the adobe towns for the weekend. They even drive in cars all full of thermos bottles and mayonnaisey sandwiches and some kind of latticework wooden-back support for the old crock who drives and Venetian blinds on the back window.<br><br>"The black panther."<br><br>"Pan-thuh."<br><br>"Poon-thuh."<br><br>"Mee-dah."<br><br>Nobody says it to the two old crocks directly. God, they must be practically 50 years old. Naturally, they're carrying every piece of garbage imaginable: the folding aluminum chairs, the newspapers, the lending-library book with the clear plastic wrapper on it, the sunglasses, the sun ointment, about a vat of goo--<br><br>It is a Mexican standoff. In a Mexican standoff, both parties narrow their eyes and glare but nobody throws a punch. Of course, nobody in the Pump House crowd would ever even jostle these people or say anything right to them; they are too cool for that.<br><br>Everybody in the Pump House crowd looks over, even Tom Coman, who is a cool person. Tom Coman, 16 years old, got thrown out of his garage last night. He is sitting up on top of the railing, near the stairs, up over the beach, with his legs apart. Some nice long willowy girl in yellow slacks is standing on the sidewalk but leaning into him with her arms around his body, just resting. Neale Jones, 16, a boy with great lank perfect surfer's hair, is standing nearby with a Band-Aid on his upper lip, where the sun has burnt it raw. Little Vicki Ballard is up on the sidewalk. Her older sister, Liz, is down the stairs by the Pump House itself, a concrete block, 15 feet high, full of machinery for the La Jolla water system. Liz is wearing her great "Liz" styles, a hulking rabbit-fur vest and black-leather boots over her Levi's, even though it is about 85 out here and the sun is plugged in up there like God's own dentist lamp and the Pacific is heaving in with some fair-to-middling surf. Kit Tilden is lollygagging around, and Tom Jones, Connie Carter, Roger Johnson, Sharon Sandquist, Mary Beth White, Rupert Fellows, Glenn Jackson, Dan Watson from San Diego, they are all out here, and everybody takes a look at the panthers.<br><br>The old guy, one means, you know, he must be practically 50 years old, he says to his wife, "Come on, let's go farther up," and he takes her by her fat upper arm as if to wheel her around and aim her away from here.<br><br>But she says, "No! We have just as much right to be here as they do."<br><br>"That's not the point--"<br><br>"Are you going to--"<br><br>"Mrs. Roberts," the work-a-hubby says, calling his own wife by her official married name, as if to say she took a vow once and his word is law, even if he is not testing it with the blond kids here--"farther up, Mrs. Roberts."<br><br>They start to walk up the sidewalk, but one kid won't move his feet, and, oh, god, her work-a-hubby breaks into a terrible shaking Jell-O smile as she steps over them, as if to say, Excuse me, sir, I don't mean to make trouble, please, and don't you and your colleagues rise up and jump me, screaming Gotcha--<br><br>Mee-dah!<br><br>But exactly! This beach is verboten for people practically 50 years old. This is a segregated beach. They can look down on Windansea Beach and see nothing but lean tan kids. It is posted "no swimming" (for safety reasons), meaning surfing only. In effect, it is segregated by age. From Los Angeles on down the California coast, this is an era of age segregation. People have always tended to segregate themselves by age, teenagers hanging around with teenagers, old people with old people, like the old men who sit on the benches up near the Bronx Zoo and smoke black cigars. But before, age segregation has gone on within a larger community. Sooner or later during the day everybody has melted back into the old community network that embraces practically everyone, all ages.<br><br>But in California today surfers, not to mention rock 'n' roll kids and the hot-rodders or Hair Boys, named for their fanciful pompadours--all sorts of sets of kids--they don't merely hang around together. They establish whole little societies for themselves. In some cases they live with one another for months at a time. The "Sunset Strip" on Sunset Boulevard used to be a kind of Times Square for Hollywood hot dogs of all ages, anyone who wanted to promenade in his version of the high life. Today "The Strip" is almost completely the preserve of kids from about 16 to 25. It is lined with go-go clubs. One of them, a place called It's Boss, is set up for people 16 to 25 and won't let in anybody over 25, and there are some terrible I'm-dying-a-thousand-deaths scenes when a girl comes up with her boyfriend and the guy at the door at It's Boss doesn't think she looks under 25 and tells her she will have to produce some identification proving she is young enough to come in here and live The Strip kind of life and--she's had it, because she can't get up the I.D. and nothing in the world is going to make a woman look stupider than to stand around trying to argue I'm younger than I look, I'm younger than I look. So she practically shrivels up like a Peruvian shrunken head in front of her boyfriend and he trundles her off, looking for some place you can get an old doll like this into. One of the few remaining clubs for "older people," curiously, is the Playboy Club. There are apartment houses for people 20 to 30 only, such as the Sheri Plaza in Hollywood and the E'Questre Inn in Burbank. There are whole suburban housing developments, mostly private developments, where only people over 45 or 50 can buy a house. Whole towns, meantime, have become identified as "young": Venice, Newport Beach, Balboa--or "old": Pasadena, Riverside, Coronado Island.</p><h2>The Idea of Biodiversity: Philosophies of Paradise</h2><p><p>"At places distant from where you are, but also uncomfortably close," writes David Takacs, "a holocaust is under way. People are slashing, hacking, bulldozing, burning, poisoning, and otherwise destroying huge swaths of life on Earth at a furious pace." And a cadre of ecologists and conservation biologists has responded, vigorously promoting a new definition of nature: biodiversity--advocating it in Congress and on the Tonight Show; whispering it into the ears of foreign leaders; redefining the boundaries of science and politics, ethics and religion, nature and our ideas of nature. These scientists have infused the environmental movement with new focus and direction, but by engaging in such activities, they jeopardize the societal trust that allows them to be public spokespersons for nature in the first place.</p><p>The Idea of Biodiversity analyzes what biodiversity represents to the biologists who operate in broader society on its behalf, drawing on in-depth interviews with the scientists most active today in the mission to preserve biodiversity, including Peter Raven, Thomas Lovejoy, Jane Lubchenco, and Paul Ehrlich. Takacs explores how and why these biologists shaped the concept of biodiversity and promoted it to society at large--examining their definitions of biodiversity; their opinions about spirituality and its role in scientific work; the notion of biodiversity as something of intrinsic value; and their views on biophilia, E. O. Wilson's idea that humans are genetically predisposed to love nature. Takacs also looks at the work of twentieth-century forerunners of today's conservation biologists--Aldo Leopold, Charles S. Elton, Rachel Carson, David Ehrenfeld--and points out their contributions to the current debates. He takes readers to Costa Rica, where a group of scientists is using biodiversity to remake nature and society. And in an extended section, he profiles the thoughts and work of E. O. Wilson. </p><p>"When I'm asked, 'should we save this species orthat species, or this place or that place?' the answer is always 'Yes!' with an exclamation point. Because it's obvious. And if you ask me to justify it, then I switch into a more cognitive consciousness and can start giving you reasons, economic reasons, aesthetic reasons. They're all dualistic, in a sense. But the feeling that underlies it is that 'yes!' And that 'yes!' comes out of the affirmation of being part of it all, being part of this whole evolutionary process. And agreeing with Arne Naess that each species, each entity, should be allowed to continue its evolution and to live out its destiny... just do its thing, as we say. Why not? And the 'why not?' is there's too many people."--Michael E. Soule, from an interview in The Idea of Biodiversity "An important contribution, a first distanced examination of a critical, modern topic by a scholarly, honest broker."--E. O. Wilson, Harvard University</p></p><p><p>Takacs explores how and why biologists shaped the concept of biodiversity and promoted it to society at large--examining their definitions of biodiversity; their opinions about spirituality and its role in scientific work; the notion of biodiversity as something of intrinsic value; and their views on biophilia, E.

In Wharton's American revision, it is the woman herself who ruthlessly sells herself to whatever man she believes can provide her with the success she desires. Undine Spragg is a magnificent antiheroine, viciously and precisely rendered by the author.<br><br>With photographs by Alvin Langdon Coburn and drawings by Charles Dana Gibson, this Collector's Edition evokes the atmosphere of nineteenth-century New York.

From 1963 through 1984 she spoke for Seth, who described himself as an "energy personality essence no longer focused in physical reality." In addition to nine books by Seth she also wrote fourteen books of her own. The Jane Roberts/Seth material, which includes many volumes of unpublished material, is housed at the Yale University Archives and is consistently one of the top two most visited collections in the archives. <p> Because of her contribution to the study of consciousness, Moment Point Press has dedicated its Classics in Consciousness series to Jane Roberts. In addition to Psychic Politics look for new editions of Roberts's Adventures in Consciousness (available now) and The God of Jane (available in February 2000)</p>Jane Roberts insights into time, gravity, and space are far richer than any I have seen in the reports of top physicists attempting to deal with the same questions. . . . She writes with amazing presence and grace about her personal journey into parallel selves. -- <i>Fred Alan Wolf, Ph.D., National Book-Award Winning Author of <i>Taking the Quantum Leap</i> and <i>The Spiritual Universe</i></i><br><br>Jane Roberts possessed a combination of psychic talent and intellectual curiosity that contributed enormously to our understanding of human consciousness. -- <i>Norman Friedman, author of <i>Bridging Science and Spirit</i> and <i>The Hidden Domain</i></i><br><br>Roberts's genius at asking brave new questions about her own psychic experiences, and about the more "common" events we all experience, led her to a new understanding of the connection between our inner and outer lives. For anyone, academic or non, who is interested in understanding consciousness, Psychic Politics is a must-read. We can all benefit from Roberts's discoveries. -- <i>Lynda Madden Dahl, award-winning author of <i>Beyond the Winning Streak</i> and <i>Ten Thousand Whispers</i></i><br><br>With its unequivocal affirmation of the conscious mind, Psychic Politics is the ultimate field guide to the links between our inner, subjective lives and the events that unfold in the so-called objective world.

Following the third day of the Battle of Glorieta Pass, the Texans realized their predicament: "Here we are between two armies, one double ours and the other four times our number, 1,000 miles from home, not a wagon, not a dust of flour, not a pound of meat." While the Confederates had forced a Union retreat on the rocky, forested battlefield around Pigeon's Ranch, they could not press their advantage. The most crippling blow had come in the surprise destruction of all seventy supply wagons at Johnson's Ranch by Colorado Volunteers. So complete was their devastation that during a truce in the early evening, the Texans even had to borrow Union shovels to bury their dead.</p><br><p>"A superbly researched and well-written study of the Battle of Glorieta Pass that is likely to be definitive."--Jerry Thompson, author of <i>Confederate General of the West: Henry Hopkins Sibley</i></p></p><p>A highly readable account of this major turning point of the Civil War in the West.Thomas S.

Not only do we have a glorious mandate to teach all nations the gospel , we also have numerous charges to teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom. In formal and informal settings, as parents or leaders or friends, we are constantly teaching and learning. Not only has the Lord commanded us to teach, but He has taught us what we are to teach and how we are to do it: diligently and by the power of the Spirit. But how do we know if we&#39;re doing it right. What signs can we watch for that the Spirit is actually present in a teaching setting? In this insightful companion volume to Hearing the Voice of the Lord, bestselling author Gerald N. Lund brings his decades of experience working in the Church Educational System to the topic of teaching and learning by the Spirit. He discusses common misconceptions, important questions we should ask about our teaching, and the role of the Holy The Lord has given the responsibility to save His children to teachers,writes Elder Lund.

Peter Jarvis, an internationally known authority in the field of professional adult and continuing education, shows how theories of practice evolve from the practice itself and are unique to each practitioner. Doing professional work gives practitioners many opportunities to question, test, and revise theories taught in graduate programs. Such practice-based research gives rise to personalized theories of practice and also raises new questions for personal exploration.</p> <p>Using examples and vignettes drawn from professional fields and settings around the world, Jarvis provides valuable insights into the nature of professional practice, the ways professionals learn, and how education for practice can be enhanced at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Jarvis examines why so many practitioners find their professional education inadequate preparation for actual practice, and he calls for a partnership between higher education and the professional workplace that will meet the challenges of the relationship between the two.</p> <p><i>The Practitioner-Researcher</i> is designed to help all practitioners for whom research is a tool in improving practice--from graduate students and their professors to employees in diverse industries or professional groups--and to facilitate an understanding of the relationship between practice and theory within the worlds of work and learning.</p></p><p>PETER JARVIS is professor of continuing education at the University of Surrey, England. He works with a wide range of professionals, including those in business and management, nursing, and all levels of education. Author of fifteen books and editor of nine others, Jarvis has had his work translated into sixteen languages."Jarvis has successfully eliminated the mystery and fear of conducting academic research in this easy to read book which encourages educators and others to become practitioner-researchers." (Pade Informer)<br> <br> "Jarvis does a real service by introducing a new vision of research into the current debates over the nature and mission of the academy." (Continuing Higher Education Review)<br> <br> "At last, a window into what it means to 'learn by doing' . . . This is a remarkable book. Jarvis has managed to bridge the worlds of theory and professional practice in a way that will help each better understand the other." (Jon Wergin, professor of educational studies, School of Education, Virginia Commonwealth University)<br> <br> "Peter Jarvis's own extensive biography as scholar and practitioner shows through in this book.

Readers will delight in tales of house cats who teach monks how to meditate, shamans who shape-shift into jaguars, crickets who perform Catholic mass, rivers that grant salvation, and many others. In addition to being a collection of wonderful stories, this book introduces important concepts and approaches that underlie much recent work in environmental ethics, religion, and ecology. Daniel Capper&#x2019;s light touch prompts readers to engage their own views of humanity&#x2019;s place in the natural world and question longstanding assumptions of human superiority.</p><p>This book has been placed on suggested reading lists from the Animals and Society Institute as well as the Campaign for the American Reader.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Unique, wide ranging, and beautifully written, this powerful plea for more mutually constructive relationships offers an appreciation of the natural world and our neighbors in the nonhuman universe. <i>Learning Love from a Tiger</i> respects cultural differences and religious sensibilities even as it challenges human-on-human oppression.&#x201d;<br> Paul Waldau, Professor of Anthrozoology, Canisius College<br><br> &#x201c;Capper&#x2019;s complex and timely work addresses the multifaceted ways that religions and nature shape each other. He points out that the results are often fraught with ambivalence, an important conclusion that leaves the reader without simple answers. This book both introduces various religious traditions and delves into the complicated environmental issues that intersect, in sometimes unanticipated ways, with religion.&#x201d;<br> Laura Hobgood, Professor of Environmental Studies and Religion, Southwestern University</p><h2>Roy Lichtenstein&#39;s ABC</h2><p>An innovative alphabet book by the renowned pop artist combines Lichtenstein&#39;s distinctive combination of popular imagery and artistic techniques reminiscent of advertising and comic book art. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>This little ABC book is so wonderful that adults may have trouble sharing it with the babies, toddlers, and growing children in their midst. Every two-page spread contains an alphabet letter and a painting by Roy Lichtenstein, one of the first and most successful of the pop artists. The 26 letters here were each lifted from one of Lichtenstein's prints, drawings, or paintings, and each has a style and a presence all its own, apart from the art on the facing page. Finally, below each member of the alphabet, in comic-book type, are a few words that begin with that letter and refer to objects or ideas pictured in the art on the opposite page. Lichtenstein, who died in 1997, was a witty and subtly classical artist who combined humor and whimsy in his work with an effortless dignity and a broad knowledge of art history. His comics-derived imagery was so crisp and stylish when he first rose to prominence--so <i>now</i>, as one might have said in the '60s--that viewers were surprised when in the 1980s he began painting monumental images of abstract friezes from ancient temples. This little book is tremendously appealing, showing paintings of water lilies, dogs, a sweet kiss, a "Matisse" still life with goldfish (and a golf ball), a nurse, a cup of coffee, an ice-cream soda, and other recognizable images. Babies and toddlers especially will love to peruse its pages, and art-loving parents everywhere will be enthralled. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i>American pop art painter, graphic artist and sculptor, Roy Lichtenstein is best known for his large-scale renditions of comic-strip art. He died in 1997.</p><h2>The French Army and the First World War (Armies of the Great War)</h2><p>This is a comprehensive new history of the French army&#39;s critical contribution to the Great War. Ranging across all fronts, Elizabeth Greenhalgh examines the French army&#39;s achievements and failures and sets these in the context of the difficulties of coalition warfare and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the enemy forces it faced. Drawing from new archival sources, she reveals the challenges of dealing with and replenishing a mass conscript army in the face of slaughter on an unprecedented scale, and shows how, through trials and defeats, French generals and their troops learned to adapt and develop techniques which eventually led to victory. In a unique account of the largest Allied army on the Western Front, she revises our understanding not only of wartime strategy and combat, but also of other crucial aspects of France&#39;s war, from mutinies and mail censorship to medical services, railways and weapons development.</p><p>A comprehensive new history of the French army&#39;s critical contribution to the Great War.

The novel interweaves their endless suppositions into a work that is at once political parable and surreal fantasia. Some think X is 50 years old; others that she is 22. Some believe she has occult powers and has thereby enslaved the young men of the street; others think she is a clever trickster playing mind games with the common people. Who is Madam X? How has she brought the good people of Five Spice Street to their knees either in worship or in exasperation? The unknown narrator takes no sides in the endless&nbsp;interplay of visions, arguments, and opinions. The investigation rages, as the street becomes a Walpurgisnacht of speculations, fantasies, and prejudices. Madam X is a vehicle whereby the people bare their souls, through whom <i>they</i> reveal themselves even as they try to penetrate the mystery of her extraordinary powers.</p><p><i>Five Spice Street</i> is one of the most astonishing novels of the past twenty years. Exploring the collective consciousness of this little street of ordinary people, Can Xue penetrates the deepest existential anxieties of the present day&#x2014;whether in China or in the West&#x2014;where the inevitable impermanence of identity struggles with the narrative within which identity must compose itself.</p></p><p><b>Can Xue</b> is the pseudonym of Deng Xiaohua, author of many novels and short works of fiction in Chinese. She lives in Beijing.The inhabitants of Five Spice Street gossip, spy and seduce one another in this lovely surrealist romp. At the center of the drama is Madame X, a mysterious figure who has a strange hold on her neighbors' imaginations. She could be anywhere from 22 to 50 years old, according to her neighbors, and her notions were deeply at odds with the traditions of Five Spice Street. Much of the fascination comes from her affair with Mr. Q. Meanwhile, a figure known only as the widow spends her time protecting the neighborhood from Madame X and Mr. Q by reading their letters, investigating their rooms and making bold, if unsubstantiated, claims about their character. The translators do a marvelous job of preserving the prose's lyricism, which enhances the surreal scenes that seem to be the stuff of everyday life on Five Spice Street. Xue's stridently weird and vainglorious characters are quite a bizarre retinue, and the air of paranoia and mystery is perfectly captured. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Covey illustrates how his principles of leadership can be applied to children of all ages. </b><br><br>In today&#x2019;s world, we are inundated with information about who to be, what to do, and how to live. But what if there was a way to learn not just what to think about, but how to think? A program that taught young people how to manage priorities, focus on goals, and be a positive influence in their schools?<br> <br><i>The Leader in Me</i> is that program. In this bestseller, Stephen R. Covey took the <i>7 Habits</i> that have already changed the lives of millions of readers and showed that even young children can use them as they develop. These habits are being adapted by schools around the country in leadership programs, most famously at the A.B Combs Elementary school in Raleigh. Not only do the programs work, but they work better than anyone could have imagined. This book is full of examples of how the students blossom under the program&#x2014;from the classroom that decided to form a support group for one of their classmates who had behavioral problems to the fourth grader who overcame his fear of public speaking and took his class to see him compete in a national story telling competition.<br> <br>Perfect for individuals and corporations alike, <i>The Leader in Me</i> shows how easy it is to incorporate these skills into daily life so kids of all ages can be more effective, goal-oriented, and successful.</p><p>Recognized as one of <i>Time</i> magazine&#x2019;s twenty-five most influential Americans, Stephen R. Covey (1932&#x2013;2012) was an internationally respected leadership authority, family expert, teacher, organizational consultant, and author.&nbsp;His books have sold more than twenty-five million copies&nbsp;in thirty-eight languages, and <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> was named the #1 Most Influential Business Book of the Twentieth Century. After receiving an MBA from Harvard and a doctorate degree from Brigham Young University, he became the cofounder and vice chairman of FranklinCovey, a leading global training firm.The Leader in Me 1<p></p> Too Good to Be True?<p></p> <br>When I first started telling people about this leadership model, there were several naysayers who thought it all a bunch of &#x201c;fluff.&#x201d; But now they are believers.<br> <br>&#x2014;Leslie Reilly, Seminole County Public Schools, Florida<br> <br>When the first edition of The Leader in Me was published toward the end of 2008, it began with the story of Drs. Rig and Sejjal Patel. They had just moved their family to Raleigh, North Carolina, and begun the task of looking for a school where their children could learn in a safe and mind-stimulating environment. As they talked to neighbors and colleagues, the name of one school kept popping up: A.B. Combs Elementary.<br> <br>On paper, A.B. Combs was quite ordinary. It was a public school in a suburban neighborhood. There were nearly nine hundred students, of whom 18 percent spoke English as a second language, 40 percent qualified for free or reduced lunches, and 21 percent were placed in special programs. The building that housed them was fifty years old. Some teachers had been there for years.<br> <br>But while on paper A.B. Combs appeared nothing too unusual, the stories the Patels kept hearing exceeded their loftiest expectations. They heard about confident and respectful students, an engaged staff, strong test scores, and a &#x201c;Principal of the Year.&#x201d; Discipline problems were minimal, and students who had struggled at other schools were progressing well at this one. It all sounded pretty good. In fact, to the Patels, it sounded a bit &#x201c;too good to be true.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Patels decided to see the school firsthand. What they discovered was that just entering the front doors was an engaging experience. There was a feeling not felt in many schools. The walls were cheery and even motivational. Diversity was celebrated. They found that all students and staff learned The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, the same leadership principles that top leaders around the world have been trained in for years. They observed that all students were assigned leadership roles, and that many decisions were made by students, not teachers. They saw students setting academic and personal goals and tracking progress in personalized notebooks. All this they found remarkable, enough so that they left the visit sensing that what they had been hearing about A.B. Combs was true after all.<br><br> <br>A.B. Combs Elementary is a public school located in Raleigh, North Carolina.<br><br>The Patels ended up enrolling their children. Those children have now graduated and moved on, having had a memorable experience. Many other parents have since visited A.B. Combs to see for themselves if the school is too good to be true. Most are not only pleased with what they see, they are delighted to discover that more than two thousand schools have now embarked on the same process, spanning over thirty countries.<br> What About for You?<p></p> <br>The reason why the Patels, others, and perhaps even you have questioned the reports about A.B. Combs as being too good to be true is that they are in such stark contrast to what we have become accustomed to hearing in recent years. We are so inundated with stories of bullying, rude manners, low test scores, disrespect, lack of discipline, violence, poor graduation rates, mediocre teachers, and so forth, that many people are fully skeptical that anything so positive can come from schools. Either they find it too hard to believe, or they question its sustainability.<br> <br>Such skepticism has value. It cautions us against latching on to every flashy fad or flimsy program that comes along, only to see it fade with no lasting impact. Yet while skepticism has its benefits, it is a sour source to draw upon for vision and passion. Skepticism is a critic, not a model. Skepticism does not think out of the box; it shrinks the box. Skepticism designs weak school-improvement strategies and anemic lesson plans. That is why skepticism and its peers&#x2014;pessimism, cynicism, apathy, and despair&#x2014;should never be hired to run a school, a classroom, a counseling office, a library, or a playground.<br> <br>A far better source of inspiration for making decisions and leading in a school is hope. Hope informs us of better ways of doing things. Hope keeps students and staff members progressing. Hope shines light beyond the darkness of school tragedies. Hope sees potential in people&#x2014;all people.<br> <br>What the Patels and now many more parents are witnessing at A.B. Combs and these schools is hope. They see hope in the form of teachers engaged in their work. They see hope in the form of students learning skills that will help them throughout life. They see hope in the form of involved and satisfied parents. All this is bringing a new level of hope to the field of education under the banner of The Leader in Me.<br> <br>As you come to the conclusion of this book, we hope you will have enough insight into The Leader in Me to determine whether or not you feel it is too good to be true.<br> Matching Today&#x2019;s Realities<p></p> <br>A comment we hear regularly is that what the schools highlighted in this book are doing is &#x201c;perfectly matched to today&#x2019;s realities.&#x201d; Let us explain.<br> <br>Not that long ago, we lived in the information age. In that age, the individuals with the most &#x201c;facts&#x201d; in their heads scored highest on fact-based exams, which got them into the best fact-based universities, which accelerated their climb up the best fact-based career ladders. In those days, about all schools needed to worry about was inserting as many academic facts into students&#x2019; brain cells as possible.<br> <br>Well, that era is over. It has given way to the age of the knowledge worker. What happened is that the same facts that we formerly tried to cram into students&#x2019; heads, and were once available only from top experts and top universities, are now accessible to most every nook on the planet. Whether sitting on a plane, waiting for a bus, working at a desk, or living in a thatched hut, people can now access more facts in a matter of seconds from pocket-sized devices than they could from spending an entire month in a university library only a short time ago. As a result, many of the elite jobs that previously required extensive factual knowledge are being handed off to computers or individuals with far fewer credentials. Factual knowledge alone, therefore, is no longer the great differentiator between those who succeed in the new reality and those who do not.<br> <br>So if factual knowledge is no longer king, what then is the great differentiator between those who succeed in the new reality and those who do not? According to Daniel Pink and others, those who are succeeding are those who possess above-average creativity, strong problem-solving skills, and a knack for foresight. They are the inventors, designers, big-picture thinkers, meaning makers, and pattern recognizers. They are those who know how to analyze, optimize, synthesize, present, and do worthwhile things with facts. That is why they are called knowledge workers.<br> <br>But there is more.<br> <br>With the shift to the age of the knowledge worker has come simultaneous shifts in societal norms. Among them is the reality that more and more students are heading home after school to sit behind locked doors and play video games by themselves until mom or dad arrives home at night. Many of the games entail seek-to-destroy activities with no need to communicate or work out amenable solutions with others, and no real consequences. Other students are opting to get together with friends after school digitally rather than meeting face-to-face. One school we work with reports that 90 percent of its students come from single-mother homes, with most of those students having never met their fathers. Another is in a drug-infested area and its exterior walls are pocked with bullet holes. Meanwhile, advances in technology and transportation have turned the world into a global playing field and more students are thinking in terms of being global citizens. Others feel they are entitled to certain privileges. And the list of societal shifts goes on, many of which are causing adults to wonder how today&#x2019;s students will ever learn to communicate properly, to resolve conflicts in a civil fashion, to work with people of diverse backgrounds, or to effectively lead their lives in a competitive world that is in commotion.<br> <br>The last few decades have belonged to a certain kind of person with a certain kind of mind&#x2014;computer programmers who could crank code, lawyers who could craft contracts, MBAs who could crunch numbers. But the keys to the kingdom are changing hands.<br> <br>&#x2014;Daniel Pink, A Whole New Mind<br> <br>So yes, we know it is an old line but &#x201c;Times have changed.&#x201d; In fact, they have changed so much that the age of the knowledge worker is no longer sufficient to describe our age. That is why Daniel Pink has observed that, in addition to possessing the traits of knowledge workers, the people who are truly thriving in today&#x2019;s reality are those who are also good listeners and team builders. They are able to &#x201c;understand the subtleties of human interaction, to find joy in one&#x2019;s self and to elicit it in others.&#x201d; They may not know all the facts themselves but do know how to bring the right people together to assemble the facts and derive solutions. They are those who have empathy skills and can leverage people&#x2019;s opinions and talents. In other words, they not only have the ability to work with knowledge, they also have&#x2014;surprise, surprise!&#x2014;good people skills.<br> <br>Pink is by no means singing solo. As we will see in Chapter 2, other experts have been signaling the same new reality for some time. They are not referring to a futuristic world, they are speaking of now! What they are calling for is for educators to take a hard, fresh look at how they approach three rapidly evolving challenges in the new reality:<br> <br>Academics. In today&#x2019;s world, students must learn how to not just memorize and regurgitate academic facts but also apply them to authentic situations. They must have stronger analytical, critical-thinking, problem-solving, and creativity skills to succeed in the years ahead. For this to happen, educators must reexamine and adjust their teaching styles and curriculums to accommodate this way of learning and applying.<br> <br>School culture. What school in today&#x2019;s reality is not scrambling to deal with disengaged students, bullying, discipline issues, low attendance, or student loneliness? What school does not face pockets of poor staff collaboration, low teacher engagement, a lack of common vision, resistance to change, poisonous gossip, or apathetic parents? Whereas in the past, schools could allow their culture to grow naturally, today&#x2019;s schools cannot afford to make culture building a passive endeavor. A more proactive approach is needed.<br> <br>Life skills. There is an increasingly urgent call for more personal and interpersonal skills to be taught in schools. Sometimes they are called workforce-, career-, or college-readiness skills, or social-emotional learning skills, or simply life skills. Regardless of name, many students are showing up to college, work, parenthood, and life without them. This deficit explains in part why more than 30 percent of students are dropping out of college in the first year. They lack skills for leading their lives, being on their own, or interfacing with others. It used to be assumed that they would learn such skills at home, but that no longer is a sound assumption.<br><br> <br>Three Evolving Challenges.<br><br>Of course, none of these three challenges is entirely new. Schools have been dealing with all three for years. What is new is the seismic pressure being heaved upon educators to raise the bar in all three areas. It is all part of the new reality.<br> <br>So how are today&#x2019;s schools responding to the new reality? According to the legendary Howard Gardner the answer is, not well. In his book Five Minds for the Future he asserts that &#x201c;current formal education still prepares students primarily for the world of the past, rather than for the possible worlds of the future.&#x201d; Similarly, in How Children Succeed, Paul Tough insists that &#x201c;the conventional wisdom about child development over the past few decades has been misguided. We have been focusing on the wrong skills and abilities in our children, and we have been using the wrong strategies to help nurture and teach these skills.&#x201d;<br> <br>But one does not need to be a guru to make such observations. How often do we hear today&#x2019;s business leaders groan about the new employee they hired who is very bright yet has no clue how to work in teams, to prioritize time, or to present ideas clearly? How many parents complain that their newly crowned high school graduate excelled on all the college entrance exams but does not know how to pursue a goal, to resolve conflicts maturely, or to socialize with anything other than a digital screen? Ask these leaders and parents if they feel students are being adequately prepared for today&#x2019;s world, and chances are their responses will be a united and anguished &#x201c;NO!&#x201d;<br> <br>More will be said about the three evolving challenges as the book progresses. Suffice it here to say that one reason people comment that The Leader in Me is perfectly matched to today&#x2019;s realities is that it is helping many schools to more effectively address all three challenges. And perhaps the best news is that many educators are saying, &#x201c;This is not one more thing we have to do, but a better way of doing what we are already doing.&#x201d;<br><br> <br>The new reality demands a new way of educating students the world over.<br><br> A New Level of Thinking?<p></p> <br>A question always on our minds is if the field of education as a whole is approaching the three challenges at the right levels of thinking. Albert Einstein warned, &#x201c;We cannot solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created those problems.&#x201d; In other words, before attempting to address the three challenges, we may need to step back and challenge our ways of thinking&#x2014;to reexamine our paradigms.<br> <br>For years, Dr. Martin Seligman has been one of the world&#x2019;s foremost psychologists. More recently he has become known as the father of positive psychology, a relatively new branch of study. It came about while he was president of the American Psychological Association (APA), but more specifically while he was in his garden. In his insightful book Authentic Happiness, he describes how he was tidying his garden one day while his five-year-old daughter, Nikki, was nearby and engaged in happy mischief. At some point Nikki&#x2019;s bouncing and ramblings became too much and he yelled at her, causing her to go away.<br> <br>Before long, however, Nikki was back, saying, &#x201c;Daddy, I want to talk to you.&#x201d; She said, &#x201c;Daddy, do you remember before my fifth birthday? From when I was three until when I was five, I was a whiner. I whined every day. On my fifth birthday, I decided I wasn&#x2019;t going to whine anymore. That was the hardest thing I have ever done. And if I can stop whining you can stop being such a grouch.&#x201d;<br> <br>To Seligman&#x2019;s credit, he listened. And after some soul-searching and marveling at his daughter&#x2019;s positive nature, he declared, &#x201c;In that moment, I resolved to change.&#x201d;<br> <br>That brief exchange not only inspired Dr. Seligman to change his disposition at home; it redirected his career. He realized that the field of psychology had for the better part of a century been focused on &#x201c;fixing people.&#x201d; It was centered on identifying what was wrong and on relieving suffering. He began to wonder if there could be a field of psycho...</p><h2>The Dictionary of Anthropology</h2><p><i>The Dictionary of Anthropology </i>is designed to become the standard reference guide to the discipline of social and cultural anthropology.

(1)<br>&nbsp;<br>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.<br>&nbsp;<br>"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady (2) to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?" (3)<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. (4)<br>&nbsp;<br>"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. Bennet made no answer.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.<br>&nbsp;<br>"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."<br>&nbsp;<br>This was invitation enough.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four (5) to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, (6) and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week." (7)<br>&nbsp;<br>"What is his name?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Bingley."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Is he married or single?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. (8) What a fine thing for our girls!"<br>&nbsp;<br>"How so? how can it affect them?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Is that his design in settling here?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party."<br>&nbsp;<br>"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."<br>&nbsp;<br>"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think_of."<br>&nbsp;<br>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."<br>&nbsp;<br>"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."<br>&nbsp;<br>"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment (9) it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas (10) are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no new comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not." (11)<br>&nbsp;<br>"You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters." (12)<br>&nbsp;<br>"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves." (13)<br>&nbsp;<br>"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Ah! you do not know what I suffer."<br>&nbsp;<br>"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."<br>&nbsp;<br>"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all." (14)<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, (15) sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. <i>Her</i> mind (16) was less difficult to develope. (17) She was a woman of mean understanding, (18) little information, (19) and uncertain temper. (20) When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. (21) The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news. (22)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Annotations &#x2013; Chapter 1</b><br>&nbsp;<br>1. The famous opening line, with wonderful economy, accomplishes two main purposes. It indicates the novel's central subject of marriage, along with the financial considerations usually involved in it. It also sets the tone of irony that will pervade the book, for in fact, as we immediately see, it is the single women in this society who are truly in want, or need, of a man of large fortune. The term "acknowledged" adds to this effect, for it suggests the possibility that this supposed truth about single men may be more valid in people's beliefs than in reality.<br>&nbsp;<br>2. <i>his lady</i>: his wife.<br>&nbsp;<br>3. Netherfield Park is the name for a home in the Bennets' neighborhood. It was common for houses, if grand enough, to be given a name, often with words such as park in them to indicate their attractive and rustic character.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was not unusual for large houses to be rented out, for it cost a substantial amount of money to staff and maintain a grand home, and many landowners might find themselves unable to afford it. In Jane Austen's <i>Persuasion</i> the heroine's family, thanks to the father's extravagant spending habits, is forced to let their house and move into apartments in the resort city of Bath.<br>&nbsp;<br>4. Until its concluding paragraph, the entire rest of the chapter consists of dialogue between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. Dialogue occupies much of Jane Austen's novels, and presentation of character through dialogue is one of her fortes as a novelist. In this case, Mrs. Bennet's excitable exclamations and exaggerated phrasing reveal her flightiness and impetuousness, while Mr. Bennet's terseness and irony reveal his cool detachment.<br>&nbsp;<br>5. <i>chaise and four</i>: chaise is a type of carriage; it seated three people, all facing forward, and was enclosed (see illustration on p. 397). Four refers to the number of horses pulling it. A chaise was a popular vehicle for long-distance travel, so it would be a logical one for someone coming from far away to use (in this case, as we find out later, it happens to be the carriage Mr. Bingley owns and uses regularly).<br>&nbsp;<br>6. <i>Michaelmas</i>: September 29. It was one of the four days used to divide the year into quarters; the other three were Christmas, Lady Day (March 25), and Midsummer Day (June 24). The action of the novel, which is carefully worked out chronologically, will terminate around Michaelmas of the following year; most of Jane Austen's novels transpire over an approximate period of one year.<br>&nbsp;<br>7. It was common for servants to precede their masters in order to prepare a house for the latter's arrival.<br>&nbsp;<br>8. <i>four or five thousand a year</i>: his annual income in pounds. This is the way Jane Austen usually describes men's wealth; the income would normally come from the agricultural profits on land or from other property and invest-ments (in Bingley's case it turns out to be the latter). It is not easy to translate incomes of the time into today's money. By some calculations, the effects of inflation mean that a pound in Jane Austen's time has the same value as almost forty pounds today; if so, Bingley's income would be the equivalent of 150,000 to 200,000 a year in today's pounds (or around $250,000-$300,000 in current U.S. money). Altered economic condition, however, make estimates like this tricky: for example, goods tended to be much dearer at that time, in relative terms, while labor tended to be much cheaper. In addition, average incomes in this period, even when adjusted for inflation, were much lower than today, so Bingley's income represents a far sharper deviation from the prevailing norm than its current equivalent would be.<br>&nbsp;<br>Another way to look at the issue is to note that in <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> a mother is able to support herself and three daughters in reasonable comfort in a nice home she has rented, and with a staff of three servants, on five hundred a year. Jane Austen herself lived most of her life on less than that. The Bennets themselves have an income of 2,000 a year (to which should be added a house and its contents). Hence Bingley, however one calculates it, is a truly rich man, which is why he is such a desirable matrimonial prospect.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mrs. Bennet's statement about Bingley's income, uttered before he has even arrived, reveals the speed with which vital information about people could circulate. The principal means for this is local gossip, which plays a central role in this society. The gossip would be greatly assisted by the many servants in employment, for the servants in one household could tell its secrets to servants in other households, who could in turn tell their employers. This process is mentioned later in this novel, as it is in other Jane Austen novels, most notably in <i>Emma</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>9. <i>establishment</i>: marriage.<br>&nbsp;<br>10. <i>Sir William and Lady Lu...</i></p><h2>All Grown Up</h2><p><b>From the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-selling author of<i>&nbsp;The Middlesteins</i>&nbsp;comes a wickedly funny novel about a thirty-nine-year-old single, childfree woman who defies convention as she seeks connection.</b><br><br> Who is Andrea Bern? When her therapist asks the question, Andrea knows the right things to say: she&#x2019;s a designer, a friend, a daughter, a sister. But it&#x2019;s what she leaves unsaid&#x2014;she&#x2019;s alone, a drinker, a former artist, a shrieker in bed, captain of the sinking ship that is her flesh&#x2014;that feels the most true. Everyone around her seems to have an entirely different idea of what it means to be an adult: her best friend, Indigo, is getting married; her brother&#x2014;who miraculously seems unscathed by their shared tumultuous childhood&#x2014;and sister-in-law are having a hoped-for baby; and her friend Matthew continues to wholly devote himself to making dark paintings at the cost of being flat broke.<br> &nbsp;<br> But when Andrea&#x2019;s niece finally arrives, born with a heartbreaking ailment, the Bern family is forced to reexamine what really matters. Will this drive them together or tear them apart? Told in gut-wrenchingly honest, mordantly comic vignettes,<i> All Grown Up</i> is a breathtaking display of Jami Attenberg&#x2019;s power as a storyteller, a whip-smart examination of one woman&#x2019;s life, lived entirely on her own terms.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of March 2017:</strong> A friend came to my apartment for the first time recently, frowning at the futon in the living room. &#x201c;A futon?! You&#x2019;re not in your 20s anymore!&#x201d; Evidently a couch, an actual couch, is an indicator of adulthood&#x2014;as is marriage, and the requisite 2.5 kids. By those standards, thirty-nine-year-old Andrea Bern, the unapologetically single and childless protagonist of Jami Attenberg&#x2019;s bitingly funny and heartrending <em>All Grown Up</em> doesn&#x2019;t fit the bill, and she&#x2019;s fine with that (if her mother and much of society is not). But while living a life according to one&#x2019;s own playbook has its perks, it also has pitfalls, and Andrea isn&#x2019;t immune to a little existential crisis. Cue the passive aggressive trips to her therapist, a revolving door of unsuitable suitors, and the near-abandonment of one of the true loves of her life: her art. So steeped in ennui is she that Andrea (almost) fails to register when life tries to yank her from it; Her best friend&#x2019;s seemingly perfect marriage is imploding, as well as her brother and sister-in-law&#x2019;s&#x2014;the result of trying to cope with their child&#x2019;s precarious, and incurable illness. And they <em>need</em> Andrea, something that takes a little while to sink in, but once it does, she realizes that the road to adulthood is not paved with &#x201c;real&#x201d; furniture. It&#x2019;s an epiphany that will punch you in the heart, and Attenberg has perfect aim. <em>--Erin Kodicek, The Amazon Book Review</em>JAMI ATTENBERG is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of seven books of fiction, including <i>The Middlesteins</i> and <i>All Grown Up.</i> She has contributed essays to the <i>New York Times Magazine,</i> the <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> the<i> Sunday Times,</i> and <i>Longreads,</i> among other publications.

In the 1950s, Charles Fraser transformed this almost forgotten barrier island into one of America's premier vacation destinations and, in doing so, invented the modern resort and retirement community. In this case study of that archetypal development and the others that followed on Hilton Head Island, Michael N. Danielson explores the interplay of private power and public authority as well as the dilemma of growth in America's recreation-based communities.<br>Danielson contends that Hilton Head offers fertile ground for evaluating the influence of private elites and public officials on largely self-contained resort and retirement communities, an increasingly important but previously unexamined component of urban growth in America.<br>Identifying growth as the island's central political issue, Danielson submits that resorts like Hilton Head face the similar predicament - the reality that economic expansion alters the very attributes that attracted developers, residents, and vacationers to a particular locale. His case study illustrates the impact of growth on the economic and political fortunes of a geographic area and the residents living in it.</p><p>Michael N.

George Cobb&#39;s goals in Introduction to Design and Analysis of Experiments are to explain how to choose sound and suitable design structures and to engage the student in understanding the interpretive and constructive nature of data analysis and experimental design. Developed over years of classroom use, this text can be used as an introduction to statistics emphasizing experimental design. Technical prerequisites are kept to a minimum. It can also be used as an elementary graduate survey course. Cobb&#39;s approach and careful exposition allow students to build a deep understanding of statistical concepts over time as they analyze and design experiments. He presents the field of statistics to students as a matrix, rather than a hierarchy, of related concepts. This text introduces the main concepts of statistical thinking in the context of experimental design and ANOVA, allowing the material to be covered in half of the usual time. Introduction to Design and Analysis of Experiments was originally published by Springer-Verlag, New York and is now being reprinted by Key College Publishing. It is available for sale from either publisher.</p><p></p><h2>Ancient Israelite Religion</h2><p><em>Ancient Israelite Religion</em> offers a brief, accessible, and perceptive account of the religious beliefs and practices of the ancient Israelites, analyzing the complex and varied ways in which they present and preserve themselves in the Hebrew Bible. Drawing on the most recent literary scholarship and archaeological evidence, the author provides a compelling account of how the culture of the Israelites changed over three great historical periods--the distant pre-monarchic age, the monarchies of Israel and Judah, and the Babylonian exile and return. The heart of the book is a rich description of the Israelites' religious life as revealed in the Hebrew Bible. Exploring how they described their experience of God, Niditch draws out consistent themes in the Biblical stories. Most importantly, she allows us to see the world through the Israelites' eyes as she reconstructs both their habits and their larger worldview. <br> Ideal for introduction to the Bible and introduction to religion courses, this insightful, subtly nuanced portrait is also easily understandable to general readers. It brings to life this ancient people whose legacy continues to influence and captivate the world today.<br></p><p>Susan Niditch is at Amherst College.An overly brief but very well organized and informative overview of Judaism's formative stage during the 13th to 5th centuries b.c. Bible scholar Niditch (Religion/Amherst Coll.) focuses on the worldview expressed in the Hebrew Bible. She devotes chapters to four aspects of that worldview: the experiential, the mythical, the ritual, and the ethical-legal, largely basing her analysis on close readings of biblical texts. Sometimes, though unfortunately not often enough, she uses insight garnered from archaeological findings or the texts of other ancient Near Eastern religions. Niditch's greatest strength is her succinct, accessible prose; there is solid scholarship, but no academic pretentiousness or jargon here. She is particularly good at capturing and evoking an aspect of ancient Judaism in a sentence or a phrase. For example, after exploring the Yom Kippur ritual of the scapegoat that is prescribed in Leviticus, she observes how it is linked to other biblical rituals involving uncleanliness and danger, then concludes that ``sin, like the seductive personification in the story of Cain and Abel, the one who crouches at the door, is real and visceral, a contaminant which makes impossible a healthful continuation of the covenant community.'' Also enhancing her book is an excellent bibliography. The work's only weakness is an occasional penchant for deriving conclusions from insufficient evidence. An example: Niditch states that the context and content of the ritual of redeeming the first-born son (see Exodus 22) ``seems to be support that child sacrifice was indeed a thread in ancient Israelite religion.'' Far more evidence is needed for this spectacular claim. On balance, though, this is a first-rate introduction, for undergraduate and graduate students and all serious students of Judaism, to the social, cultural, intellectual, and spiritual underpinnings of the Hebrew Bible.

Also deleted by Sophia are entries revealing Hawthorne's unshocked observations of the shapes of girls' legs and of such improprieties as public drunkenness. Sophia's editorial pen was equally ruthless with items of "curious lore" about such things as butter and mustard seed. Finally Hawthorne's "morbid" entries, chiefly for horror stories never written, received no mercy from his widow.

What made Douglas&#x2019;s work unique, I think, were the wildly contradictory attributes he displayed in his writing. He seamlessly blended world-class intelligence&#x2014;and a daunting knowledge about an impossible variety of subjects (literature, computers, evolution, pop culture, genetics, and music, to name but a few)&#x2014;with transcendental silliness; technophobia with a lust for, and fascination with, every high-tech toy imaginable; deep cynicism about virtually everything with an effusively joyful spirit; and one of the quickest wits on the planet with a relentless perfectionism in pursuing his craft.&#x201d; &#x2014;From the Introduction by Christopher Cerf<br><br>&#x201c;The bottom drawer of recently deceased writers is often best left firmly locked and bolted. In the case of Douglas, I am sure you will agree, the bottom drawer (or in his case, the nested subfolders of his hard drive) has been triumphantly well worth the prising open. There are those who write from time to time and do it well, and then there are Writers. Douglas Adams, and it is pointless to attempt here an explanation or anatomisation, was born, grew up, and remained a Writer to his too-early dying day. <br>&#x201c;You are on the verge of entering the wise, provoking, benevolent, hilarious, and addictive world of Douglas Adams. Don&#x2019;t bolt it all whole&#x2014;as with Douglas&#x2019;s beloved Japanese food, what seems light and easy to assimilate is subtler and more nutritious by far than it might at first appear.&#x201d; &#x2014;Stephen Fry, author of <i>The Liar</i> and <i>Making History: A Novel</i></p><h2>Numerolog�a con tantra, ayurveda y astrolog�a</h2><p>For the first time, a Tantric scholar and expert in the Hindu traditions of Ayurveda and astrology presents a system of numerology that combines numerical calculations, astrological data, and an analysis of body type.

How was it possible for white settlers to march across the entire continent, inexorably claiming Native American lands for themselves? Who made it happen, and why? This gripping book tells America&#x2019;s story from a new perspective, chronicling the adventures of our forefathers and showing how a legacy of repeated betrayals became the bedrock on which the republic was built.</p><p>Paul VanDevelder takes as his focal point the epic federal treaty ratified in 1851 at Horse Creek, formally recognizing perpetual ownership by a dozen Native American tribes of 1.1 million square miles of the American West. The astonishing and shameful story of this broken treaty&#x2014;one of 371 Indian treaties signed during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries&#x2014;reveals a pattern of fraudulent government behavior that&nbsp;again and again displaced Native Americans from their lands. VanDevelder describes the path that led to the genocide of the American Indian; those who participated in it, from cowboys and common folk to aristocrats and presidents; and how the history of the immoral treatment of Indians through the twentieth century has profound social, economic, and political implications for America even today.</p></p><p><p><b>Paul VanDevelder</b> is a journalist and author.

It contains easy-to-understand and everyday examples that reinforce basic concepts and related science principles. Chapter topics include moisture and atmospheric stability; forms of condensation and precipitation; air pressure and winds; weather patterns; thunderstorms and tornadoes; hurricanes; air pollution; and global climate change. For weather watchers who want to know <i>why.</i></p><p>Consists of 19 exercises. 3 labs require the use of personal computers. (Lab 4 is based on GeoClock--a software package for viewing Earth-sun geometry. An energy balance model, written by James E. Burt, is used in labs 6 and 16.) Both software packages are included on a diskette (IBM) in the manual. Can be value packed with Lutgens/Tarbuck, The Atmosphere, 6/E for a nominal fee.Preface <p> There are few aspects of the physical environment that influence our daily lives more than the phenomena we collectively call weather. Newspapers, magazines, and television stations regularly report a wide range of weather events as major news stories&#x2014;an obvious reflection of people's interest and curiosity about the atmosphere. We also face important environmental problems related to the atmosphere. Such issues as air pollution, ozone depletion, and global warming require our attention. A basic meteorology course can take advantage of our interest and curiosity about the weather as well as our desire to understand the impact that people have on the atmospheric environment. </p><p> The Atmosphere: An Introduction to Meteorology, Eighth Edition, is designed to meet the needs of students who enroll in such a course. It is our hope that the knowledge gained by taking a class and using this book will encourage many to actively participate in bettering the environment, and others may be sufficiently stimulated to continue their study of meteorology. Equally important, however, is our belief that a basic understanding of the atmosphere and its processes will greatly enhance appreciation of our planet and thereby enrich the reader's life. </p><p> In addition to being informative and up-to-date, a major goal of The Atmosphere is to meet the need of beginning students for a readable and user-friendly text, a book that is a highly usable "tool" for learning basic meteorological principles and concepts. Distinguishing Features Readability </p><p> The language of this book is straightforward and written to be understood. Clear, readable discussions with a minimum of technical language are the rule. The frequent headings and subheadings help students follow discussions and identify the important ideas presented in each chapter. In the present edition, improved readability was achieved by examining chapter organization and flow and writing in a more personal style. Large portions o) the text were substantially rewritten in an effort to make the material more understandable. Illustrations and Photographs </p><p> Meteorology is highly visual. Therefore, photographs and artwork are a very important part of an introductory book. The Atmosphere, Eighth Edition, contains dozens, of new high-quality photographs that were carefully selected to aid understanding, add realism, and heighten the interest of the reader. </p><p> The illustrations in each new edition of The Atmosphere keep getting better and better. In the eighth edition more than 100 pieces of line art are new o&gt; revised. The new art illustrates ideas and concepts more clearly and realistically than ever before. Dennis Tasa, a gifted artist and respected science illustrator, carried out the art program. Focus on Learning </p><p> New to the eighth edition. To assist student learning, every chapter now concludes with a Chapter Summary. When a chapter has been completed, five useful devices help students review. First, the Chapter Summary recaps all the major points. Next the Vocabulary Review provides a checklist of key terms with page references. Learning the language of meteorology helps students learn the material. This is followed by the Review Questions section, which helps students examine their knowledge of significant facts and ideas. In most chapters, Problems, with a quantitative orientation, follow the review questions. Most problems require only basic mathematical skills and allow students to enhance their understanding by applying skills and principles explained in the chapter. Each chapter closes with some suggested Web sites for further exploration. Moreover, students are reminded to visit the all-new Web site for The Atmosphere, Eighth Edition (prenhall/lutgens). It contains many excellent opportunities for review and exploration. Environmental Issues<br> and Atmospheric Hazards </p><p> Many of the serious environmental issues that face humanity are related to the atmosphere. This new edition includes up-to-date treatment of air pollution, ozone depletion, global warming, and more. </p><p> Because atmospheric hazards adversely affect millions of people worldwide every day, coverage of this topic has been expanded. At appropriate places. throughout the book students will have an opportunity to learn more about atmospheric hazards. Two entire chapters (Chapter 10, "Thunderstorms and Tornadoes" and Chapter 11, "Hurricanes") focus almost entirely on hazardous weather. In addition, a number of the book's special-interest boxes are devoted to a broad variety of atmospheric hazards including heat waves, winter storms, floods, dust storms, drought, mudslides, and lightning. Maintaining a Focus on Basic Principles </p><p> Although many topical issues are treated in the eighth edition of The Atmosphere, it should be emphasized that the main focus remains the same as that of its predecessors&#x2014;to foster a basic understanding of the atmospheric environment. In keeping with this aim, the organization of the text remains intentionally traditional. Following an overview of the atmosphere in Chapter 1, the next 10 chapters are devoted to a presentation of the major elements and concepts of meteorology. Chapter 12, on weather analysis, follows and serves to reinforce and apply many of the concepts presented in the preceding chapters. Chapter 13 is devoted to the important issue of air pollution. </p><p> The text concludes with two chapters on climate (Chapters 14 and 15), and one devoted to optical phenomena (Chapter 16). Chapter 14, "The Changing Climate," explores a topic that is the focus of much public interest as well as scientific research: Is global climate changing, and, if so, in what ways? How are people causing or contributing to these changes? The discussions in Chapter 14 have been carefully and thoroughly revised and updated to reflect the fast-changing nature of this sometimes controversial subject. More About the Eighth Edition </p><p> In addition to adding chapter summaries, strengthening the atmospheric hazards theme, and making substantial changes to the photography and art programs, much more is new to the eighth edition. </p><p> This latest edition of The Atmosphere represents a thorough revision. Every part of the book was examined carefully with the dual goals of keeping topics current and improving the clarity of text discussions. Based on feedback from reviewers and students, we believe we have succeeded. Supplements </p><p> The authors and publisher have been pleased to work with a number of talented people to produce an excellent supplements package. This package includes the traditional supplements that students and instructors have come to expect from authors and publishers. </p><p> Internet Support. Authored by Kenneth G. Pinzke, of Belleville Area College, this new site, specific to the text, contains numerous review exercises (from which students get immediate feedback), exercises to expand one's understanding of weather and climate, and resources for further exploration.

And why does Arthurian myth continue to flourish in films today? This witty and accessible introduction takes readers on a quest through the history of Arthurian romance in order to find the answers. Medieval expert, Derek Pearsall, traces the fortunes of Arthur, Guenevere, Lancelot, Gawain, Tristan, and the other knights of the round table at the hands of different writers, artists, and film-makers. He follows the evolution of Arthurian romance from the epic form into ballad, drama, elegy, satire, and burlesque, showing how the story has continued to provide a medium through which different cultures could express their highest hopes and contain their deepest fears. The book consists mainly of readings of the great works of Arthurian romance, from Chretien de Troyes through Malory to Tennyson and beyond, but also pays attention to manuscript illustrations, tapestries, paintings, and films.<b>Derek Pearsall</b> is Gurney Professor of English, Emeritus, at Harvard University and Honorary Research Professor at the University of York. His previous publications include a study of <i>Landscapes and Seasons of the Medieval World</i> (with Elizabeth Salter, 1973), a history of <i>Old English and Middle English Poetry</i> (1977), editions of <i>Piers Plowman</i> (1978) and Chaucer&#x2019;s<i> Nun&#x2019;s Priest&#x2019;s Tale </i>(1983), a critical study of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i> (1985), <i>The Life of Geoffrey Chaucer</i> (Blackwell Publishing, 1992), and <i>Chaucer to Spenser: An Anthology</i> (Blackwell Publishing, 1999).</p><h2>The Blood of the Lamb: A Novel</h2><p><p>The most poignant of all De Vries's novels, <i>The Blood of the Lamb</i> is also the most autobiographical. It follows the life of Don Wanderhop from his childhood in an immigrant Calvinist family living in Chicago in the 1950s through the loss of a brother, his faith, his wife, and finally his daughter-a tragedy drawn directly from De Vries's own life. Despite its foundation in misfortune, <i>The Blood of the Lamb</i> offers glimpses of the comic sensibility for which De Vries was famous. Engaging directly with the reader in a manner that buttresses the personal intimacy of the story, De Vries writes with a powerful blend of grief, love, wit, and fury.<br></p></p><p><b>Peter De Vries</b> (1910&#x2013;1993), the man responsible for contributing to the cultural vernacular such witticisms as "Nostalgia ain't what it used to be" and "Deep down, he's shallow," was, according to Kingsley Amis, "the funniest serious writer to be found on either side of the Atlantic." But De Vries's life and work was informed as much by sorrow as by wit."Funny, angry, and thoroughly human, <i>The Blood of the Lamb</i> is the best novel about cancer I've ever read." (John Green, author of "The Fault in Our Stars" <i>The Week</i> 2014-06-06)<br><br><p>"With luck,&nbsp;a writer capable of producing both <i>Slouching Towards Kalamazoo</i> and <i>The Blood of the Lamb</i> will not remain unappreciated for long."</p> (Adam Kirsch <i>The New York Sun</i> 2005-06-22)<br><br>"My favorite novel of [2005] is the University of Chicago Press reprint of Peter DeVries&#x2019; <i>The Blood of the Lamb</i>, a tirade against faith inspired by the death of the author&#x2019;s daughter. Not since Graham Greene&#x2019;s <i>The End of the Affair</i> has a book rendered man&#x2019;s rage against a hostile God so visceral.... DeVries&#x2019; Don Wanderhope moves deftly from manic hilarity to manic fury, and back again, as he tells his story. At the end, all humor drains away in a strange, explosive and utterly hopeless confrontation with the divine." (Maud Newton <i>Newsday</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;One of my favorite books ever.&#x201d; (John Green, author of "The Fault in Our Stars" <i>www.johngreenbooks.com</i>)<br><br>"If Peter De Vries did not write the latter part of 'The Blood of the Lamb' with his own life's blood, I never have read a book that was so written. It plainly is autobiographical, and for poignant, sensitive treatment of the death of a beloved child it has scarcely a superior in contemporary fiction." (Fanny Butcher <i>Chicago Tribune</i>)<br><br>"A masterpiece of realism and literary craftsmanship. It tells a poignant story without relying on sentiment or sacrificing humor." (J.E. Bruns <i>Catholic World</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;De Vries was an editor at <i>Poetry</i> magazine, a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker</i>, and the author of some two dozen of the wittiest novels you&#x2019;ll ever read, including the masterworks <i>The Blood of the Lamb</i> and <i>Slouching Toward Kalamazoo</i>, as well as <i>The Tunnel of Love</i> and <i>Reuben, Reuben</i>, just resurrected in handsome paperback by the University of Chicago Press. . . . Only those with a consummate lack of cleverness wield the word &#x2018;clever&#x2019; as an insult, and De Vries demonstrates just how much can be done with a creative intelligence charged by the clever and satirical and ironic. Let us now praise those saints at the University of Chicago Press who possess the smarts and good taste to return to print a peerless American maestro of wit.&#x201d; (William Giraldi <i>The Millions</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Quick with quips so droll and witty, so penetrating and precise that you almost don&#x2019;t feel them piercing your pretensions, Peter De Vries was perhaps America&#x2019;s best comic novelist not named Mark Twain. . . . It&#x2019;s something of a crime against literature that De Vries, whose novels of the 1950s and early &#x2019;60s made wonderful sport of postwar striving, the middle-class move to the suburbs, and generational clashes that would render major cultural shifts just a few years hence, has mostly been forgotten. . . . Literature&#x2014;in the form of the University of Chicago Press&#x2014;is making amends for its lapses by re-issuing the best of De Vries&#x2019; works, five comic tomes long out of print.&#x201d; (Sam McManis <i>Sacramento Bee</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Wounded as De Vries was, he stumbled forward in the manner he knew: by writing. He rendered the world as precisely as he could, with violence, beauty, grief, and humor intermingled.

It aims to break down barriers&#x2015;between language and culture, poetry and history&#x2015;that have stood in the way of teaching and learning Chinese poetry. Not only a primer in early Chinese poetry, the volume demonstrates the unique and central role of poetry in the making of Chinese culture.<br><br> Each chapter focuses on a specific theme to show the interplay between poetry and the world. Readers discover the key role that poetry played in Chinese diplomacy, court politics, empire building, and institutionalized learning; as well as how poems shed light on gender and women&#x2019;s status, war and knight-errantry, Daoist and Buddhist traditions, and more. The chapters also show how people of different social classes used poetry as a means of gaining entry into officialdom, creating self-identity, fostering friendship, and airing grievances. The volume includes historical vignettes and anecdotes that contextualize individual poems, investigating how some featured texts subvert and challenge the grand narratives of Chinese history. Presenting poems in Chinese along with English translations and commentary, <i>How to Read Chinese Poetry in Context </i>unites teaching poetry with the social circumstances surrounding its creation, making it a pioneering and versatile text for the study of Chinese language, literature, history, and culture.</p><p>Zong-qi Cai is professor of Chinese and comparative literature at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and chair professor of Chinese literature at Lingnan University of Hong Kong.

Twenty-one million Americans are affected by 6,000 so-called rare and orphan diseases, many of which are primarily attributable to misspelled genes. And virtually all diseases have a significant hereditary component. Diabetes, heart disease, the common cancers, mental illness, asthma, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and more are having their secrets unlocked through DNA. Families that faced common problems, without hope, are now discovering a new world of understanding, treatment, and prevention. You owe it to yourself to learn about your DNA: how it works, what it reveals, and the benefits and limits of this new knowledge. </p></p><p><p>Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., is a pioneer gene hunter. He spent fifteen years as director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, where he led the international Human Genome Project to a successful completion. For his revolutionary contributions to genetic research he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2007, and the National Medal of Science in 2009. He is the Director of the National Institutes of Health.</p>Starred Review. A medical revolution is upon us and bestselling author Collins (<i>The Language of God</i>), director of the National Institutes of Health, does a fabulous job of explaining its dimensions. Our knowledge of the genetic basis for disease has increased exponentially in recent years, and we are now able to understand and treat diseases at the molecular level with personalized medicine&#x2014;care based on an individual's genetic makeup. Collins presents cutting-edge science for lay readers who want to take control of their medical lives. In an enjoyable form, he discusses cancer, obesity, aging, racial differences, and a host of other concerns. Most fascinating is the way Collins discusses the medical advances currently in place and those soon to come that are directly attributable to the federal government's Human Genome Project, headed by Collins, and which mapped the entire human genome. Collins is also not shy about taking on large political issues. He points out problems with our current health-care system, discusses stem-cell research, and in a cogent commentary, recommends&#x2014;with caveats&#x2014;direct-to-consumer DNA testing. By using case studies throughout, he does a superb job of humanizing a complex scientific and medical subject.

Daphne Berdahl, through ongoing ethnographic research in a former East German border village, explores the issues of borders and borderland identities that have accompanied the many transitions since 1990. What happens to identity and personhood, she asks, when a political and economic system collapses overnight? How do people negotiate and manipulate a liminal condition created by the disappearance of a significant frame of reference?<br><br>Berdahl concentrates especially on how these changes have affected certain "border zones" of daily life&#x2015;including social organization, gender, religion, and nationality&#x2015;in a place where literal, indeed concrete, borders were until recently a very powerful presence. Borders, she argues, are places of ambiguity as well as of intense lucidity; these qualities may in fact be mutually constitutive. She shows how, in a moment of headlong historical transformation, larger political, economic, and social processes are manifested locally and specifically. In the process of a transition between two German states, people have invented, and to some extent ritualized, cultural practices that both reflect and constitute profound identity transformations in a period of intense social discord. <i>Where the World Ended</i> combines a vivid ethnographic account of everyday life under socialist rule and after German reunification with an original investigation of the paradoxical human condition of a borderland.</p><p>"Berdahl's vibrant book tackles core themes and weaves together pressing issues in dynamic ways. . . . It is theoretically sophisticated and well-written, [and] there are, to my knowledge, no books quite like this in the field at present.

Longterm practitioners of alternative farming methods (see, e.g., Michael Phillips's The Apple Grower: A Guide for the Organic Orchardist), the Phillipses believe that while medical doctors are sometimes needed, herbalists still have much to offer. Writing in a style that is sometimes feisty and frequently spiritual, the authors provide a broad overview of herbal medical practice, offering their philosophy of earth-based healing and wellness, brief information on specific plants, and instructions on preparing some herbal products (such as decoctions, salves, and oils). Given the New Age tone, some readers may view this book with suspicion but they are not the intended audience. This title does not present in-depth information on specific herbs and their culture and use what most public library users want but it instead introduces a philosophy as old as humankind.

Coming in at only 5,000 Chinese characters, its timeless wisdom has inspired millions of people around the world and serves as one of the cornerstones of the Taoist religion. <p></p><p>It has been translated into English many, many times, but this new work by the best-selling writing team of Jeff Pepper and Xiao Hui Wang is much more than a translation. The authors have taken the unusual step of not just giving you the English translation, but also showing, word by word, how one gets from the original Chinese characters to the English version. Each of the 81 short chapters contains a beautiful English translation, followed by a word-by-word and line-by-line breakdown of the chapter, showing the original Chinese, the pinyin (phonetic spelling in English characters), a word-for-word literal translation into English, and occasional helpful notes to help the reader better understand the translation. The result is a book that can be read casually, or studied carefully, or anything in between.</p><p></p><p>This new translation expresses the DDJ in simple language that anyone can access. In their Authors' Notes they say: "This is a book for ordinary people, not scholars. Many DDJ translations have been created by scholars for other scholars, and while we have studied many of them and owe a debt of gratitude to those scholars, we feel that the DDJ&#x2019;s message is simple, practical and universal, and we want everyone to have the chance to benefit from it. We try to follow the guidance of Laozi in Chapter 70, who tells us, in his usual elliptical way: "My words are very easy to understand, very easy to practice. In this world, they can&#x2019;t be understood, and can&#x2019;t be practiced."</p><p></p><p>It&#x2019;s impossible to do a 100% literal translation of the DDJ. Ordinary modern Chinese is quite different from Western languages, and the language used in this book is even more different. To start with, the original DDJ is extremely compact. Its verses have very few connecting words, forcing the reader to think deeply about the verse in order to tease out its underlying meaning or meanings. Some words can, depending on context, serve as nouns, verbs, adjectives or adverbs. Verbs in Chinese generally have no past, present or future tense, nouns have no gender (male/female), and no number (singular/plural). And to make things even more difficult, helpful little words like prepositions and pronouns are often missing entirely. As a result, translating literally from Chinese to English usually results in gibberish. Pepper and Wang have added just enough connecting words so that the sentence makes sense, while still expressing Laozi&#x2019;s thoughts as concisely as possible. They've also tried really hard to avoid the temptation to add things that weren&#x2019;t already there in order to make the sentence more readable.</p><p></p><p>A Pocket Edition of this book is also available. The Pocket Edition contains only the English translation, not the original Chinese or the detailed translation notes. It's only 114 pages vs. 380 pages, and it's a smaller size (5"x8" instead of 6"x9"), making it a better fit for the pants pocket.</p></p><p><i>People are born soft and weak,</i><br><i>They die hard and strong.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>All creatures, grass and trees are born soft and fragile,</i><br><i>They die dry and withered.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Hard and strong are disciples of death,</i><br><i>Soft and weak are disciples of life.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>An unyielding army is defeated,</i><br><i>An unbending tree is ready to fall.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Big and strong dwell below,</i><br><i>Soft and flexible dwell above.&nbsp;</i><br><br>The Dao De Jing, also called the Tao Te Ching, was originally written in the 6th century BCE by the Chinese sage Laozi.

Such data ular event, such as the death are generically referred to as survival data. However, the event of interest need not necessarily be death, but could, for example, be the end of aperiod spent in remission from a disease, relief from symptoms, or the recurrence of a particular condition. Although there are a number of books devoted to the analysis of sur� vival data, this book is designed to meet the need for an intermediate text which emphasises the application of the methodology to survival data arising from med� ical studies, which shows how widely-available computer software can be used in survival analysis, and which will appeal to statisticians engaged in medical re� search. This book is based on a course on the analysis of survival data from clinical trials which has been given annually by the Statistical Services Centre ofthe Department of Applied Statistics, University of Reading, since 1986. Although it is written primarily for those working as statisticians in the pharmaceutical industry and in medical research institutes, much of the text should be accessible to numerate scientists and clinicians working alongside statisticians on the analysis of their own data sets. This book could also be used as a text to accompany undergraduate and postgraduate courses on survival analysis in universities and other institutes of higher education.</p><p><p>Collett has succeeded admirably in updating the first edition of his book ...

It has undermined European security, raised questions about NATO's future, and put an end to one of the most ambitious projects of U.S. foreign policy&#x2015;building a partnership with Russia. It also threatens to undermine U.S. diplomatic efforts on issues ranging from terrorism to nuclear proliferation. And in the absence of direct negotiations, each side is betting that political and economic pressure will force the other to blink first. Caught in this dangerous game of chicken, the West cannot afford to lose sight of the importance of stable relations with Russia.</p><p>This book puts the conflict in historical perspective by examining the evolution of the crisis and assessing its implications both for the Crimean peninsula and for Russia's relations with the West more generally. Experts in the international relations of post-Soviet states, political scientists Rajan Menon and Eugene Rumer clearly show what is at stake in Ukraine, explaining the key economic, political, and security challenges and prospects for overcoming them. They also discuss historical precedents, sketch likely outcomes, and propose policies for safeguarding U.S.-Russia relations in the future. In doing so, they provide a comprehensive and accessible study of a conflict whose consequences will be felt for many years to come.</p></p><p>The End of Alliances.

Herter Professor of American Foreign Policy, The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, and author of <i>The Road to Global Prosperity</i><br><br><i>Conflict in Ukraine</i> provides a timely assessment of one of several recent strategic developments that mark the passing of the 'post&#x2013;Cold War' world. The careful attention to the subtle interplay of domestic and international politics, and of history and current events, is all too rare in foreign policy analysis. Though the book places the bulk of responsibility for the military escalation of the dispute over Ukraine's future on Russia, the authors scrupulously assess the roles of Ukraine itself, the U.S., and Europe in setting the stage for the ultimate crisis. The authors are modest about their ability to predict, but they lay out a set of plausible hypotheses about the likely course of the dispute, which we can employ to order new facts as they emerge.<p></p>&#x2015;<b>Barry R.

Drawing on impeccable expertise built up over decades, Menon and Rumer provide an elegantly described context for understanding the history, politics, and economics of the showdown over Ukraine. They convincingly argue that Ukraine's crisis is a symptom of larger geopolitical trends that require hard-headed planning for a new security architecture for Europe.<p></p>&#x2015;<b>Jack Snyder</b>, Robert and Ren�e Belfer Professor of International Relations, Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies, Columbia University</p><h2>Human Body, Grades 4 - 6 (Skills for Success)</h2><p>Learning about the human body is fascinating!

His early stories portray the loveless lives of lunch-cart workers, stripteasers and sailors. In later years, the comfortably upper-middle-class novelist grew sickened with modern life's rootlessness and materialism. Donaldson, biographer of Fitzgerald and Hemingway, has achieved a coup of investigative reporting in this first in-depth biography of the writer. A troubled adolescent who felt unloved and guilty over his bisexuality, Cheever made love the central concern of his fiction. Donaldson delves into the writer's deteriorating marriage, his alcoholism, persistent phobias and self-disgust, his affairs with actress Hope Lange and composer Ned Rorem, blending in sensitive appraisals of the short stories and novels. Cheever's implicit belief that women and men are basically irreconcilable is analyzed in the context of his relationship to a dominant mother and a weak father who failed in business. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Cheever's prodigious talents earned him the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the loyalty of myriad readers. His luminous fictions penetrated the inner life of American suburbia, but his own interior self was an agonizing contradiction from youth until his death in 1981. This scholarly biography portrays a devoted family man obsessed by love affairs, a disciplined worker impaired by alcoholism, a self-doubter known for his wit and charm. Donaldson uses telling interviews with surviving relatives and friends to leaven and enliven this candid, moving chronicle, which adds to and complements Susan Cheever's popular memoir, Home Before Dark.

In complementary essays, a photo historian and a photographer reassess this important picture, rediscovering the complex social and aesthetic ideas that informed it and explaining how over the years it has achieved its status as a masterpiece. What aspects of Stieglitz&#x2019;s ideas and sometimes-murky ambitions help us understand the picture&#x2019;s achievements? How should we assess the photograph in relation to Stieglitz&#x2019;s many writings about it? The authors of this book explore what <i>The Steerage</i> might mean in at least two senses&#x2015;by itself, as a grand and self-sufficient work, and also ineluctably bound up with the many stories told about it. They make the photograph, today, what Stieglitz himself made it over the years&#x2015;a photo-text work.</p><p>&#x201c;Alfred Stieglitz&#x2019;s <i>The Steerage</i> (1907) is one of the most famous images of the twentieth century, and one which raises complex issues regarding art photography and subject matter. The pairing of Anne MacCauley&#x2019;s well-contextualized historical analysis with Jason Francisco&#x2019;s more philosophical and poetic reading gives great insight into this important photograph. Together, they offer a new and fascinating take on a canonical work.&#x201d;&#x2015;Kim Sichel, author of <i>Germaine Krull: Photographer of Modernity</i>.<br><br>&#x201c;It is past time for the history of Stieglitz' <i>The Steerage</i>to be deconstructed, and for the myths surrounding it to be replaced with rational analysis. McCauley&#x2019;s and Francisco&#x2019;s essays are each well-conceived and executed, filled with promising ideas, new ways of approaching this canonic image, and tactics for separating myth from truth. Together they present a beautiful contrast of styles, and make this book a very important re-evaluation of a well-known masterpiece." &#x2015;Joel Leivick, Robert and Ruth Halperin Professor in Photography, Department of Art and Art History, Stanford University<b>Jason Francisco</b> is an acclaimed photographer and the Chair of the Visual Arts Department at Emory University.

In 1915, against the backdrop of the Mexican Revolution, the uprising that would become known as the Plan de San Diego began with a series of raids by ethnic Mexicans on ranches and railroads. Local violence quickly erupted into a regional rebellion. In response, vigilante groups and the Texas Rangers staged an even bloodier counterinsurgency, culminating in forcible relocations and mass executions.</p><p><br> Faced with the overwhelming forces arrayed against it, the uprising eventually collapsed. But, as Johnson demonstrates, the rebellion resonated for decades in American history. Convinced of the futility of using force to protect themselves against racial discrimination and economic oppression, many Mexican Americans elected to seek protection as American citizens with equal access to rights and protections under the U.S. Constitution.</p></p><p>&#34;Benjamin Johnson&#39;s study of the Plan de San Diego uprising is a clear, absorbing analysis of a bloody but little-known revolt along a border that&#39;s been troubled ever since it was a border.

In Cicero's <i>Letters to Atticus</i> we get an intimate look at his motivations and convictions and his reactions to what is happening in Rome. These letters also provide a vivid picture of a momentous period in Roman history, years marked by the rise of Julius Caesar and the downfall of the Republic.</p><p>When the correspondence begins in November 68 BCE, the 38-year-old Cicero is a notable figure in Rome: a brilliant lawyer and orator, he has achieved primacy at the Roman bar and a political career that would culminate in the Consulship in 63. Over the next twenty-four years&#x2014;until November 44, a year before he was put to death by the forces of Octavian and Mark Antony&#x2014;Cicero wrote frequently to his friend and confidant, sharing news and views and discussing affairs of business and state. It is to this corpus of over 400 letters that we owe most of our information about Cicero's literary activity. Here too is a revealing picture of the staunch republican's changing attitude toward Caesar. And taken as a whole the letters provide a first-hand account of social and political life in Rome.</p></p><p><p>D. R.

From coast to coast, Native Americans had created enduring cultures, and the subsequent European invasion remade much of the land and society. In <i>New Worlds for All</i>, Colin G. Calloway explores the unique and vibrant new cultures that Indians and Europeans forged together in early America. The journey toward this hybrid society kept Europeans' and Indians' lives tightly entwined: living, working, worshiping, traveling, and trading together&#x2015;as well as fearing, avoiding, despising, and killing one another.

This book is not a brief survey (you noticed that already; I had intended it to be, but it got the bit between its teeth and ran away from me), nor, on the other hand, is it a reference book that covers all the facts and dates about Hinduism or a book about Hinduism as it is lived today. Several books of each of those sorts exist, some of them quite good, which you might read alongside this one.1&nbsp;<i>The Hindus: An Alternative History</i>&nbsp;differs from those books in several ways.<br><br> First, it highlights a narrative alternative to the one constituted by the most famous texts in Sanskrit (the literary language of ancient India) and represented in most surveys in English. It tells a story that incorporates the narratives of and about alternative people&#x2014;people who, from the standpoint of most high-caste Hindu males, are alternative in the sense of otherness, people of other religions, or cultures, or castes, or species (animals), or gender (women). Part of my agenda in writing an alternative history is to show how much the groups that conventional wisdom says were oppressed and silenced and played no part in the development of the tradition&#x2014;women, Pariahs (oppressed castes, sometimes called Untouchables)&#x2014;did actually contribute to Hinduism. My hope is not to reverse or misrepresent the hierarchies, which remain stubbornly hierarchical, or to deny that Sanskrit texts were almost always subject to a final filter in the hands of the male Brahmins (the highest of the four social classes, the class from which priests were drawn) who usually composed and preserved them. But I hope to bring in more actors, and more stories, upon the stage, to show the presence of brilliant and creative thinkers entirely off the track beaten by Brahmin Sanskritists and of diverse voices that slipped through the filter, and, indeed, to show that the filter itself was quite diverse, for there were many different sorts of Brahmins; some whispered into the ears of kings, but others were dirt poor and begged for their food every day.<br><br> Moreover, the privileged male who recorded the text always had access to oral texts as well as to the Sanskrit that was his professional language. Most people who knew Sanskrit must have been bilingual; the etymology of &#x201c;Sanskrit&#x201d; (&#x201c;perfected, artificial&#x201d;) is based upon an implicit comparison with &#x201c;Prakrit&#x201d; (&#x201c;primordial, natural&#x201d;), the language actually spoken. This gives me a double agenda: first to point out the places where the Sanskrit sources themselves include vernacular, female, and lower-class voices and then to include, wherever possible, non-Sanskrit sources. The (Sanskrit) medium is not always the message; a it&#x2019;s not all about Brahmins, Sanskrit, the&nbsp;<i>Gita</i>. I will concentrate on those moments within the tradition that resist forces that would standardize or establish a canon, moments that forged bridges between factions, the times of the &#x201c;mixing of classes&#x201d; (<i>varna-samkara</i>) that the Brahmins always tried&#x2014;inevitably in vain&#x2014;to prevent.<br><br> Second, in addition to focusing on a special group of actors, I have concentrated on a few important actions, several of which are also important to us today: nonviolence toward humans (particularly religious tolerance) and toward animals (particularly vegetarianism and objections to animal sacrifice) and the tensions between the householder life and renunciation, and between addiction and the control of sensuality. More specific images too (such as the transposition of heads onto bodies or the flooding of cities) thread their way through the entire historical fabric of the book. I have traced these themes through the chapters and across the centuries to provide some continuity in the midst of all the flux,2 even at the expense of what some might regard as more basic matters.<br><br> Third, this book attempts to set the narrative of religion within the narrative of history, as a linga (an emblem of the god Shiva, often representing his erect phallus) is set in a yoni (the symbol of Shiva&#x2019;s consort, or the female sexual organ), or any statue of a Hindu god in its base or plinth (<i>pitha</i>). I have organized the topics historically in order to show not only how each idea is a reaction to ideas that came before (as any good old-fashioned philological approach would do) but also, wherever possible, how those ideas were inspired or configured by the events of the times, how Hinduism, always context sensitive,3 responds to what is happening, at roughly the same moment, not only on the political and economic scene but within Buddhism or Islam in India or among people from other cultures entering India. For Hinduism, positioning kings as gods and gods as kings, seldom drew a sharp line between secular and religious power. In recent years a number of historians of religions, particularly of South Asian religions, have contextualized particular moments in the religious history of the subcontinent.4 This book attempts to extend that particularizing project to the whole sweep of Indian history, from the beginning (and I do mean the beginning, c. 50,000,000 BCE) to the present. This allows us to see how certain ongoing ideas evolve, which is harder to do with a focus on a particular event or text at a particular moment.<br><br> This will not serve as a conventional history (my training is as a philologist, not a historian) but as a book about the evolution of several important themes in the lives of Hindus caught up in the flow of historical change. It tells the story of the Hindus primarily through a string of narratives. The word for &#x201c;history&#x201d; in Sanskrit,&nbsp;<i>itihasa</i>, could be translated as &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what happened,&#x201d; giving the impression of an only slightly more modest equivalent of von Ranke&#x2019;s phrase for positivist history: &#x201c;<i>Wie es</i>&nbsp;[<i>eigentlich</i>]&nbsp;<i>gewesen ist</i>&#x201d; (&#x201c;The way it [really] happened&#x201d;). But the&nbsp;<i>iti</i>&nbsp;in the word is most often used as the Sanskrit equivalent of &#x201c;end quote,&#x201d; as in &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go [<i>iti</i>],&#x201d; he said.&nbsp;<i>Itihasa</i>&nbsp;thus implies not so much what happened as what people&nbsp;<i>said</i>&nbsp;happened (&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what he said happened&#x201d;)&#x2014;narratives, inevitably subjective narratives. And so this is a history not of what the British used to call maps and chaps (geography and biography) but of the stories in hi-story. It&#x2019;s a kind of narrative quilt made of scraps of religion sewn in next to scraps of social history, a quilt like those storytelling cloths that Indian narrators use as mnemonic devices to help them and the audience keep track of the plot. The narrator assembles the story from the quilt pieces much as the French rag-and-bones man, the&nbsp;<i>bricoleur</i>, makes new objects out of the broken-off pieces of old objects (bricolage).5<br><br> Like any work of scholarship, this book rests on the shoulders of many pygmies as well as giants. I have kept most of the scholarly controversies out of the text, after laying out the rules of the game in these first two chapters of methodological introduction and in the pre-Vedic period (chapters 2 through 4), which might stand as paradigms for what might have been done with all the other chapters, as well as a few other places where the arguments were so loony that I could not resist the temptation to satirize them. Many a &#x201c;fact&#x201d; turns out, on closer inspection, to be an argument. There is another story to be told here: how we know what we know, what we used to believe, why we believe what we believe now, what scholars brought up certain questions or gave us the information we now have, what scholars now challenge that information, and what political factors influenced them. Those arguments tell a story that is interesting in itself but to which I merely allude from time to time. I also write in the shadow of a broad scholarship of theories about religion and history, and I will keep that too out of the text. I have tried to avoid setting my opinions against those with whom I disagree or using them as fall guys, beginning an argument by citing the imagined opponent. I have, rather, simply presented each subject in what I believe to be the best scholarly construction, in order to concentrate on the arguments about it within the Hindu texts themselves.<br><br> Many crucial questions remain unanswered, and I hope that this book will inspire some readers to go back to the sources and decide for themselves whether or not they agree with me. The relevant materials can be found in the bibliography as well as in the notes for each chapter, which will also provide browsing material for those readers (I confess that I am one of them) who go straight to the back and look at the notes and bibliography first, reading the book like Hebrew, from right to left, to see where the author has been grazing, like dogs sniffing one another&#x2019;s backsides to see what they have eaten lately.b<br><br> SANSKRITIZATION, DESHIFICATION, AND VERNACULARIZATION<br><br> Sanskrit texts from the earliest period assimilated folk texts that were largely oral and composed in languages other than Sanskrit, vernacular languages. But even in the Vedic age, Sanskrit was not what has been called a kitchen language, c not the language in which you said, &#x201c;Pass the butter.&#x201d;6 (Actually, Brahminsprobably did say, &#x201c;Pass the butter,&#x201d; in Sanskrit when they put butter as an oblation into the fire in the course of the sacrifice, but those same Brahmins would have to have known how to say it in another language as well, in the kitchen.) At the very least, those male Sanskritists had to be bilingual in order to talk to their wives and servants and children.d It was through those interactions that oral traditions got their foot in the Sanskrit door. Henry Higgins, in George Bernard Shaw&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Pygmalion</i>, is said to be the author of&nbsp;<i>Spoken Sanskrit</i>, and many priests and scholars can speak Sanskrit, but no one ever spoke&nbsp;<i>only</i>&nbsp;pure Sanskrit. Sanskrit and oral traditions flow back and forth, producing a constant infusion of lower-class words and ideas into the Brahmin world, and vice versa.<br><br> It must have been the case that the natural language, Prakrit, and the vernaculars came first, while Sanskrit, the refined, secondary revision, the artificial language, came later. But South Asianists often seem to assume that it is the other way around, that the dialects are &#x201c;derived from Sanskrit,&#x201d; because Sanskrit won the race to the archives and was the first to be written down and preserved, and we only encounter vernaculars much later. So we say that Sanskrit is older, and the vernaculars younger. But Sanskrit, the language of power, emerged in India from a minority, and at first its power came precisely from its nonintelligibility and unavailability, which made it the power of an elite group.7 Walt Kelly&#x2019;s Pogo used to use the word &#x201c;Sam-skrimps&#x201d; to describe highfalutin double-talk or manipulative twaddle. Many Euro-Americans mispronounce it &#x201c;Sanscript,&#x201d; implying that it is a language without (<i>sans</i>) an (intelligible) script, or &#x201c;Sand-script,&#x201d; with overtones of ruined cities in the desert or a lost language written in sand.<br><br> The sociologist M. N. Srinivas, in 1952, coined the useful term &#x201c;Sanskritization&#x201d; to describe the way that Vedic social values, Vedic ritual forms, and Sanskrit learning seep into local popular traditions of ritual and ideology (in part through people who hope to be upwardly mobile, to rise by imitating the manners and habits, particularly food taboos, of Brahmins, and in particular avoiding violence to animals).8 Indian society, in this view, is a permanent floating game of snakes and ladders (or, perhaps, snakes and ropes, recalling that Vedantic philosophers mistake snakes for ropes and that you can climb up on ropes in the Indian rope trick), which you enter in a state of impurity, gradually advancing over the generations toward the goal of Brahminical purity, trying to avoid the many pitfalls along the way.9 Tribal groups (Bhils, Gonds, etc.) might undergo Sanskritization in order to claim to be a caste, and therefore, Hindu.10<br><br> But the opposite of Sanskritization, the process by which the Sanskritic tradition simultaneously absorbs and transforms those same popular traditions, is equally important, and that process might be called oralization, or popularization, or even, perhaps, Deshification (from the &#x201c;local&#x201d; or&nbsp;<i>deshi</i>&nbsp;traditions) or Laukification, from what Sanskrit calls&nbsp;<i>laukika</i>&nbsp;(&#x201c;of the people&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>[loka]</i>). Let&#x2019;s settle on Deshification. The two processes of Sanskritization and Deshification beget each other. Similarly, through a kind of&nbsp;<i>identificatio brahmanica</i>,11 local gods take on the names of gods in Sanskrit texts: Murukan becomes Skanda, a kind of Sanskritization, while at the same time there is an&nbsp;<i>identificatio deshika</i>, by which Sanskrit gods take on the characteristics of local gods, and to the people who worship Murukan, it is Murukan who is absorbing Skanda, not the reverse. &#x201c;Cross-fertilization&#x201d; might be a good, equalizing term for the combination of the two processes.<br><br> &#x201c;Written&#x201d; does not necessarily mean &#x201c;written in Sanskrit,&#x201d; nor are oral texts always in the vernacular (the&nbsp;<i>Rig Veda,</i>&nbsp;after all, was preserved orally in Sanskrit for many centuries before it was consigned to writing). We cannot equate vernacular with oral, for people both write and speak both Sanskrit and the vernacular languages of India, though Sanskrit is written more often than spoken. The distinction between Sanskrit and the vernacular literatures is basically geographical: Though there are regional Sanskrits, the vernaculars, unlike Sanskrit, are defined and named by their place of origin (Bangla from Bengal, Oriya from Orissa, and so forth), while the script in which Sanskrit is most often written allegedly has no particular earthly place of origin (it is called &#x201c;the [script of the] city of the gods [<i>deva-nagari</i>]&#x201d;). Once people departed from the royal road of Sanskrit literary texts, there were thousands of vernacular paths that they could take, often still keeping one foot on the high road of Sanskrit.<br><br> The constant, gradual, unofficial mutual exchange between Sanskrit and the vernacular languages, the cross-fertilization, underwent a dramatic transformation toward the middle of the second millennium: Local languages were now promoted officially, politically, and artistically,12 replacing the previously fashionable cosmopolitan and translocal language, Sanskrit. Instead of nourishing and supplementing Sanskrit, the vernacular languages as literary languages began to compete with Sanskrit as the language of literary production. This process has been called, in imitation of Srinivas&#x2019;s &#x201c;Sanskritization&#x201d; (and in contrast with both Deshification and the more mutually nourishing, two-way proc...</p></p><h2>Magnetism: From Fundamentals to Nanoscale Dynamics (Springer Series in Solid-State Sciences, 152)</h2><p><p>This text book gives a comprehensive account of magnetism, one of the oldest yet most vibrant fields of physics.

It employs highly accessible explanations and a multitude of examples drawn from social issues and various academic fields, showing students and other readers how to construct and criticize arguments using the techniques of sound reasoning. <br> <em>The Voice of Reason</em> examines the traditional elements of the field and also explores new ground. The first section of the book elucidates the relationship between thought and language, explaining how words function. It discusses meaning, connotation, vagueness, ambiguity, and definition, identifying the linguistic elements that can produce mistakes in thinking. The next section describes the rules of systematic reasoning, examining such topics as truth, relevance, and adequacy; deductive logic (categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive); and induction (cause and effect, analogy, generalization, and hypothesis). Sixteen fallacies in thinking are also described through extensive illustrations and applications. The final section of the book offers a unique study of what constitutes proof in several different areas--including politics, advertising, law, and social issues--as well as in the academic disciplines of literature, science, history, and ethics. The author describes the various rules of evidence, using essays by major figures in each field as examples. <br> An ideal text for courses in critical thinking, informal logic, and reasoning and writing, <em>The Voice of Reason</em> offers numerous pedagogical features including a host of examples; assignments, exercises, and puzzles at both the halfway point and at the end of each chapter; cartoons and quotations throughout; and practical applications of theoretical concepts.
